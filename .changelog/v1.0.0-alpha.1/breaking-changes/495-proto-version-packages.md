- `[proto]` Renamed the packages from `tendermint.*` to `cometbft.*`
  and introduced versioned packages to distinguish between proto definitions
  released in 0.34.x, 0.37.x, 0.38.x, and 1.0.x versions.
  Prior to the 1.0 release, the versioned packages are suffixed with
  `.v1beta1`, `.v1beta2`, and so on; all definitions describing the protocols
  as per the 1.0.0 release are in packages suffixed with `.v1`. 
  Relocated generated Go code into a new `api` folder and changed the import
  paths accordingly.
