  * `CheckTxType` values renamed with the `CHECK_TX_TYPE_` prefix.
  * `MisbehaviorType` values renamed with the `MISBEHAVIOR_TYPE_` prefix.

    `OfferSnapshotResult`, its values named with the
    `OFFER_SNAPSHOT_RESULT_` prefix.
  * `Result` enum formerly nested in `ResponseApplyShapshotChunk` replaced with the package-level
    `ApplySnapshotChunkResult`, its values named with the
    `APPLY_SNAPSHOT_CHUNK_RESULT_` prefix.
  * `Status` enum formerly nested in `ResponseProcessProposal` replaced with the package-level
    `ProcessProposalStatus`, its values named with the
    `PROCESS_PROPOSAL_STATUS_` prefix.
  * `Status` enum formerly nested in `ResponseVerifyVoteExtension` replaced with the package-level
    `VerifyVoteExtensionStatus`, its values named with the
    `VERIFY_VOTE_EXTENSION_STATUS_` prefix.
  * New definition of `Misbehavior` using the changed `MisbehaviorType`.
  * The gRPC service is renamed `ABCIService` and defined using the types listed above.
