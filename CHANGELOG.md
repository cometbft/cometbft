## v1.0.0

*December 17, 2024*

This is a major release of CometBFT that includes several substantial changes
that aim to reduce bandwidth consumption, enable modularity, improve
integrators' experience and increase the velocity of the CometBFT development
team, including:

1. Proposer-Based Timestamps (PBTS) support. PBTS is a Byzantine fault-tolerant
   algorithm used by CometBFT for computing block times.
   When activated on a chain, it replaces the pre-existing BFT-time algorithm.
   See [spec](./spec/consensus/proposer-based-timestamp) doc for PBTS.
2. Validators now proactively communicate the block parts they already have so
   others do not resend them, reducing amplification in the network and reducing
   bandwidth consumption.
3. An experimental feature in the mempool that allows limiting the number of
   peers to which transactions are forwarded, allowing operators to optimize
   gossip-related bandwidth consumption further.
4. An opt-in `nop` mempool, which allows application developers to turn off all
   mempool-related functionality in Comet such that they can build their own
   transaction dissemination mechanism, for example a standalone mempool-like
   process that can be scaled independently of the consensus engine/application.
   This requires application developers to implement their own gossip/networking
   mechanisms. See [ADR 111](./docs/architecture/adr-111-nop-mempool.md) for
   details.
5. The first officially supported release of the [data companion
   API](./docs/architecture/adr-101-data-companion-pull-api.md).
6. Versioning of both the Protobuf definitions _and_ RPC. By versioning our
   APIs, we aim to provide a level of commitment to API stability while
   simultaneously affording ourselves the ability to roll out substantial
   changes in non-breaking releases of CometBFT. See [ADR
   103](./docs/architecture/adr-103-proto-versioning.md) and [ADR
   107](./docs/architecture/adr-107-betaize-proto-versions.md).
7. Moving many Go packages that are currently publicly accessible into the
   `internal` directory such that the team can roll out substantial changes in
   future without needing to worry about causing breakages in users' codebases.
   The massive surface area of previous versions has in the past significantly
   hampered the team's ability to roll out impactful new changes to users, as
   previously such changes required a new breaking release (which currently
   takes 6 to 12 months to reach production use for many users). See [ADR
   109](./docs/architecture/adr-109-reduce-go-api-surface.md) for more details.

None of these changes are state machine-breaking for CometBFT-based networks,
but could be breaking for some users who depend on the Protobuf definitions type
URLs.

See the [upgrading guidelines](./UPGRADING.md) and the specific changes below for more details. In this release,
we are also introducing a migration guide, please refer to the
[Upgrading from CometBFT v0.38.x to v1.0](./docs/guides/upgrades/v0.38-to-v1.0.md) document.

**NB: This version is still a release candidate, which means that
API-breaking changes, although very unlikely, might still be introduced
before the final release.** See [RELEASES.md](./RELEASES.md) for more information on
the stability guarantees we provide for pre-releases.

### BREAKING CHANGES

  ([\#1141](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/1141))
- `[abci/client]` Add fully unsynchronized local client creator, which
  imposes no mutexes on the application, leaving all handling of concurrency up

- `[blocksync]` Request the block N from peer B immediately after getting
  `NoBlockResponse` from peer A
  ([\#2475](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/2475))

  ([\#2475](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/2475))
- `[blocksync]` make the max number of downloaded blocks dynamic.
  Previously it was a const 600. Now it's `peersCount * maxPendingRequestsPerPeer (20)`
  ([\#2467](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/2467))
- `[cli/node]` The genesis hash provided with the `--genesis-hash` is now
   forwarded to the node, instead of reading the file.

- `[config]` Added `[storage.pruning]` and `[storage.pruning.data_companion]`
  sections to facilitate background pruning and data companion (ADR 101)
  operations ([\#1096](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/issues/1096))

## v0.38.0

*September 12, 2023*

This release includes the second part of ABCI++, called ABCI 2.0.
ABCI 2.0 introduces ABCI methods `ExtendVote` and `VerifyVoteExtension`.
These new methods allow the application to add data (opaque to CometBFT),
called _vote extensions_ to precommit votes sent by validators.
These vote extensions are made available to the proposer(s) of the next height.
Additionally, ABCI 2.0 coalesces `BeginBlock`, `DeliverTx`, and `EndBlock`
into one method, `FinalizeBlock`, whose `Request*` and `Response*`
data structures contain the sum of all data previously contained
in the respective `Request*` and `Response*` data structures in
`BeginBlock`, `DeliverTx`, and `EndBlock`.
See the [specification](./spec/abci/) for more details on ABCI 2.0.

### BREAKING CHANGES

- `[abci]` Introduce `FinalizeBlock` which condenses `BeginBlock`, `DeliverTx`
  and `EndBlock` into a single method call
  ([\#9468](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9468))
- `[abci]` Move `app_hash` parameter from `Commit` to `FinalizeBlock`
  ([\#8664](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/8664))
- `[config]` Remove `Version` field from `MempoolConfig`.
  ([\#260](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/issues/260))
- `[crypto/merkle]` Do not allow verification of Merkle Proofs against empty trees (`nil` root). `Proof.ComputeRootHash` now panics when it encounters an error, but `Proof.Verify` does not panic
  ([\#558](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/issues/558))
- `[inspect]` Add a new `inspect` command for introspecting
  the state and block store of a crashed tendermint node.
  ([\#9655](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9655))
- `[kvindexer]` Added support for big integers and big floats in the kvindexer.
  Breaking changes: function `Number` in package `libs/pubsub/query/syntax` changed its return value.
  ([\#797](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/797))
- `[mempool]` Application can now set `ConsensusParams.Block.MaxBytes` to -1
  to have visibility on all transactions in the
  mempool at `PrepareProposal` time.
  This means that the total size of transactions sent via `RequestPrepareProposal`
  might exceed `RequestPrepareProposal.max_tx_bytes`.
  If that is the case, the application MUST make sure that the total size of transactions
  returned in `ResponsePrepareProposal.txs` does not exceed `RequestPrepareProposal.max_tx_bytes`,
  otherwise CometBFT will panic.
  ([\#980](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/issues/980))
- `[mempool]` Remove priority mempool.
  ([\#260](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/issues/260))
- `[metrics]` Move state-syncing and block-syncing metrics to
  their respective packages. Move labels from block_syncing
  -> blocksync_syncing and state_syncing -> statesync_syncing
  ([\#9682](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9682))
- `[node/state]` Add Go API to bootstrap block store and state store to a height. Make sure block sync starts syncing from bootstrapped height.
  ([\#1057](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/#1057)) (@yihuang)
- `[state/store]` Added Go functions to save height at which offline state sync is performed.
  ([\#1057](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/#1057)) (@jmalicevic)
- `[node]` Move DBContext and DBProvider from the node package to the config
  package. ([\#9655](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9655))
- `[node]` Removed `ConsensusState()` accessor from `Node`
  struct - all access to consensus state should go via the reactor
  ([\#1120](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/1120))
- `[p2p]` Remove UPnP functionality
  ([\#1113](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/issues/1113))
- `[p2p]` Remove unused p2p/trust package
  ([\#9625](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9625))
- `[protobuf]` Remove fields `sender`, `priority`, and `mempool_error` from
  `ResponseCheckTx`. ([\#260](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/issues/260))
- `[pubsub]` Added support for big integers and big floats in the pubsub event query system.
  Breaking changes: function `Number` in package `libs/pubsub/query/syntax` changed its return value.
  ([\#797](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/797))
- `[rpc]` Remove global environment and replace with constructor
  ([\#9655](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9655))
- `[rpc]` Removed `begin_block_events` and `end_block_events` from `BlockResultsResponse`.
  The events are merged into one field called `finalize_block_events`.
  ([\#9427](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/9427))
- `[state/kvindexer]` Remove the function type from the event key stored in the database. This should be breaking only
for people who forked CometBFT and interact directly with the indexers kvstore.
  ([\#774](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/774))
- `[state]` Move pruneBlocks from node/state to state/execution.
  ([\#6541](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/6541))
- `[state]` Signature of `ExtendVote` changed in `BlockExecutor`.
  It now includes the block whose precommit will be extended, an the state object.
  ([\#1270](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/1270))

### BUG FIXES

- `[abci-cli]` Fix broken abci-cli help command.
  ([\#9717](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9717))

  `ExecTxResult` ([\#855](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/issues/855)).
- `[consensus]` Avoid recursive call after rename to (*PeerState).MarshalJSON
  ([\#863](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/863))

  ([\#524](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/524))
- `[consensus]` Unexpected error conditions in `ApplyBlock` are non-recoverable, so ignoring the error and carrying on is a bug. We replaced a `return` that disregarded the error by a `panic`.
  ([\#496](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/496))
- `[docker]` Ensure Docker image uses consistent version of Go.
  ([\#9462](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9462))
- `[kvindexer]` Forward porting the fixes done to the kvindexer in 0.37 in PR \#77
  ([\#423](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/423))
- `[light]` Fixed an edge case where a light client would panic when attempting
  to query a node that (1) has started from a non-zero height and (2) does
  not yet have any data. The light client will now, correctly, not panic
  _and_ keep the node in its list of providers in the same way it would if
  it queried a node starting from height zero that does not yet have data
  ([\#575](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/issues/575))
- `[mempool/clist_mempool]` Prevent a transaction to appear twice in the mempool
  ([\#890](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/890): @otrack)

  It will be superseded by a broader API as part of
  [\#81](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/issues/81)
  ([\#650](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/issues/650))

### FEATURES

- `[abci]` New ABCI methods `VerifyVoteExtension` and `ExtendVote` allow validators to validate the vote extension data attached to a pre-commit message and allow applications to let their validators do more than just validate within consensus ([\#9836](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9836))
- `[node/state]` Add Go API to bootstrap block store and state store to a height
  ([\#1057](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/#1057)) (@yihuang)
- `[proxy]` Introduce `NewConnSyncLocalClientCreator`, which allows local ABCI
  clients to have the same concurrency model as remote clients (i.e. one mutex
  per client "connection", for each of the four ABCI "connections").
  ([tendermint/tendermint\#9830](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9830)
  and [\#1145](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/1145))
- `[proxy]` Introduce `NewUnsyncLocalClientCreator`, which allows local ABCI
  clients to have the same concurrency model as remote clients (i.e. one
  mutex per client "connection", for each of the four ABCI "connections").
  ([\#9830](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9830))

  mempool at `PrepareProposal` time.
  ([\#980](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/980))
- `[node]` Close evidence.db OnStop ([cometbft/cometbft\#1210](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/1210): @chillyvee)

## v0.37.0

*March 6, 2023*

This is the first CometBFT release with ABCI 1.0, which introduces the
`PrepareProposal` and `ProcessProposal` methods, with the aim of expanding the
range of use cases that application developers can address. This is the first
change to ABCI towards ABCI++, and the full range of ABCI++ functionality will
only become available in the next major release with ABCI 2.0. See the
[specification](./spec/abci/) for more details.

In the v0.34.27 release, the CometBFT Go module is still
`github.com/tendermint/tendermint` to facilitate ease of upgrading for users,
but in this release we have changed this to `github.com/cometbft/cometbft`.

Please also see our [upgrading guidelines](./UPGRADING.md) for more details on
upgrading from the v0.34 release series.

Also see our [QA results](https://docs.cometbft.com/v0.37/qa/v037/cometbft) for
the v0.37 release.

We'd love your feedback on this release! Please reach out to us via one of our
communication channels, such as [GitHub
Discussions](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/discussions), with any of your
questions, comments and/or concerns.

See below for more details.

  ([\#230](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/230))
- `[types]` Reduce the use of protobuf types in core logic. `ConsensusParams`,
  `BlockParams`, `ValidatorParams`, `EvidenceParams`, `VersionParams` have
  become native types.  They still utilize protobuf when being sent over
  the wire or written to disk.  Moved `ValidateConsensusParams` inside
  (now native type) `ConsensusParams`, and renamed it to `ValidateBasic`.
  ([\#9287](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9287))

### BUG FIXES

- `[blocksync]` handle the case when the sending
  queue is full: retry block request after a timeout
  ([\#9518](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9518))
- `[consensus]` ([\#386](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/386)) Short-term fix for the case when `needProofBlock` cannot find previous block meta by defaulting to the creation of a new proof block. (@adizere)
  - Special thanks to the [Vega.xyz](https://vega.xyz/) team, and in particular to Zohar (@ze97286), for reporting the problem and working with us to get to a fix.
- `[consensus]` Fixed a busy loop that happened when sending of a block part failed by sleeping in case of error.
  ([\#4](https://github.com/informalsystems/tendermint/pull/4))
- `[consensus]` fix round number of `enterPropose`
  when handling `RoundStepNewRound` timeout.
  ([\#9229](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9229))
- `[docker]` enable cross platform build using docker buildx
  ([\#9073](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9073))
- `[docker]` ensure Docker image uses consistent version of Go
  ([\#9462](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9462))
- `[p2p]` prevent peers who have errored from being added to `peer_set`
  ([\#9500](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9500))
- `[state/kvindexer]` Fixed the default behaviour of the kvindexer to index and
  query attributes by events in which they occur. In 0.34.25 this was mitigated
  by a separated RPC flag. @jmalicevic
  ([\#77](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/77))
- `[state/kvindexer]` Resolved crashes when event values contained slashes,
  introduced after adding event sequences in
  [\#77](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/77). @jmalicevic
  ([\#382](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/382))

### FEATURES

- `[abci]` New ABCI methods `PrepareProposal` and `ProcessProposal` which give
  the app control over transactions proposed and allows for verification of
  proposed blocks. ([\#9301](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9301))

### IMPROVEMENTS

- `[abci]` Added `AbciVersion` to `RequestInfo` allowing
  applications to check ABCI version when connecting to CometBFT.
  ([\#5706](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/5706))
- `[cli]` add `--hard` flag to rollback command (and a boolean to the `RollbackState` method). This will rollback
   state and remove the last block. This command can be triggered multiple times. The application must also rollback
   state to the same height.
  ([\#9171](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9171))
- `[consensus]` Save peer LastCommit correctly to achieve 50% reduction in gossiped precommits.
  ([\#9760](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9760))
- `[crypto]` Update to use btcec v2 and the latest btcutil.
  ([\#9250](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9250))
- `[e2e]` Add functionality for uncoordinated (minor) upgrades
  ([\#56](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/56))
- `[p2p]` Reactor `Send`, `TrySend` and `Receive` renamed to `SendEnvelope`,
  `TrySendEnvelope` and `ReceiveEnvelope` to allow metrics to be appended to
  messages and measure bytes sent/received.
  ([\#230](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/230))
- `[proto]` Migrate from `gogo/protobuf` to `cosmos/gogoproto`
  ([\#9356](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9356))
- `[rpc]` Added `header` and `header_by_hash` queries to the RPC client
  ([\#9276](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9276))
- `[rpc]` Enable caching of RPC responses
  ([\#9650](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9650))
- `[tools/tm-signer-harness]` Remove the folder as it is unused
  ([\#136](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/issues/136))

## v0.34.27

*Feb 27, 2023*

This is the first official release of CometBFT - a fork of [Tendermint
Core](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint). This particular release is
intended to be compatible with the Tendermint Core v0.34 release series.

For details as to how to upgrade to CometBFT from Tendermint Core, please see
our [upgrading guidelines](./UPGRADING.md).

If you have any questions, comments, concerns or feedback on this release, we
would love to hear from you! Please contact us via [GitHub
Discussions](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/discussions),
[Discord](https://discord.gg/cosmosnetwork) (in the `#cometbft` channel) or
[Telegram](https://t.me/CometBFT).

Special thanks to @wcsiu, @ze97286, @faddat and @JayT106 for their contributions
to this release!

### BREAKING CHANGES

- Rename binary to `cometbft` and Docker image to `cometbft/cometbft`
  ([\#152](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/152))
- The `TMHOME` environment variable was renamed to `CMTHOME`, and all
  environment variables starting with `TM_` are instead prefixed with `CMT_`
  ([\#211](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/issues/211))
- Use Go 1.19 to build CometBFT, since Go 1.18 has reached end-of-life.
  ([\#360](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/issues/360))

### BUG FIXES

- `[consensus]` Fixed a busy loop that happened when sending of a block part
  failed by sleeping in case of error.
  ([\#4](https://github.com/informalsystems/tendermint/pull/4))
- `[consensus]` Short-term fix for the case when `needProofBlock` cannot find
  previous block meta by defaulting to the creation of a new proof block.
  ([\#386](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/386): @adizere)
  - Special thanks to the [Vega.xyz](https://vega.xyz/) team, and in particular
    to Zohar (@ze97286), for reporting the problem and working with us to get to
    a fix.
- `[p2p]` Correctly use non-blocking `TrySendEnvelope` method when attempting to
  send messages, as opposed to the blocking `SendEnvelope` method. It is unclear
  whether this has a meaningful impact on P2P performance, but this patch does
  correct the underlying behaviour to what it should be
  ([tendermint/tendermint\#9936](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9936))
- `[state/kvindexer]` Resolved crashes when event values contained slashes,
  introduced after adding event sequences.
  (\#[383](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/383): @jmalicevic)
