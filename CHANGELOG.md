# CHANGELOG

## v0.38.5

*January 24, 2024*

This release fixes a problem introduced in `v0.38.3`: if an application
updates the value of ConsensusParam `VoteExtensionsEnableHeight` to the same value
(actually a "noop" update) this is accepted in `v0.38.2` but rejected under some
conditions in `v0.38.3` and `v0.38.4`. Even if rejecting a useless update would make sense
in general, in a point release we should not reject a set of inputs to
a function that was previuosly accepted (unless there is a good reason
for it). The goal of this release is to accept again all "noop" updates, like `v0.38.2` did.

### IMPROVEMENTS

- `[consensus]` Add `chain_size_bytes` metric for measuring the size of the blockchain in bytes
  ([\#2093](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/2093))

## v0.38.4

*January 22, 2024*

This release is aimed at those projects that have a dependency on CometBFT,
release line `v0.38.x`, and make use of function `SaveBlockStoreState` in package
`github.com/cometbft/cometbft/store`. This function changed its signature in `v0.38.3`.
This new release reverts the signature change so that upgrading to the latest release
of CometBFT on `v0.38.x` does not require any change in the code depending on CometBFT.

### IMPROVEMENTS

- `[e2e]` Add manifest option `VoteExtensionsUpdateHeight` to test
  vote extension activation via `InitChain` and `FinalizeBlock`.
  Also, extend the manifest generator to produce different values
  of this new option
  ([\#2065](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/2065))

## v0.38.3

*January 17, 2024*

This release addresses a high impact security issue reported in advisory
([ASA-2024-001](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/security/advisories/GHSA-qr8r-m495-7hc4)).
There are other non-security bugs fixes that have been addressed since
`v0.38.2` was released, as well as some improvements.
Please check the list below for further details.

### BUG FIXES

- `[consensus]` Fix for "Validation of `VoteExtensionsEnableHeight` can cause chain halt"
  ([ASA-2024-001](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/security/advisories/GHSA-qr8r-m495-7hc4))
- `[mempool]` Fix data races in `CListMempool` by making atomic the types of `height`, `txsBytes`, and
  `notifiedTxsAvailable`. ([\#642](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/642))
- `[mempool]` The calculation method of tx size returned by calling proxyapp should be consistent with that of mempool
  ([\#1687](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/1687))
- `[evidence]` When `VerifyCommitLight` & `VerifyCommitLightTrusting` are called as part
  of evidence verification, all signatures present in the evidence must be verified
  ([\#1749](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/1749))
- `[crypto]` `SupportsBatchVerifier` returns false
  if public key is nil instead of dereferencing nil.
  ([\#1825](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/1825))
- `[blocksync]` wait for `poolRoutine` to stop in `(*Reactor).OnStop`
  ([\#1879](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/1879))

### IMPROVEMENTS

- `[types]` Validate `Validator#Address` in `ValidateBasic` ([\#1715](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/1715))
- `[abci]` Increase ABCI socket message size limit to 2GB ([\#1730](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/1730): @troykessler)
- `[state]` Save the state using a single DB batch ([\#1735](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/1735))
- `[store]` Save block using a single DB batch if block is less than 640kB, otherwise each block part is saved individually
  ([\#1755](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/1755))
- `[rpc]` Support setting proxy from env to `DefaultHttpClient`.
  ([\#1900](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/1900))
- `[rpc]` Use default port for HTTP(S) URLs when there is no explicit port ([\#1903](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/1903))
- `[crypto/merkle]` faster calculation of hashes ([#1921](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/1921))

## v0.38.2

*November 27, 2023*

This release provides the **nop** mempool for applications that want to build their own mempool.
Using this mempool effectively disables all mempool functionality in CometBFT, including transaction dissemination and the `broadcast_tx_*` endpoints.

Also fixes a small bug in the mempool for an experimental feature.

### BUG FIXES

- `[mempool]` Avoid infinite wait in transaction sending routine when
  using experimental parameters to limiting transaction gossiping to peers
  ([\#1654](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/1654))

### FEATURES

- `[mempool]` Add `nop` mempool ([\#1643](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/1643))

  If you want to use it, change mempool's `type` to `nop`:

  ```toml
  [mempool]

  # The type of mempool for this node to use.
  #
  # Possible types:
  # - "flood" : concurrent linked list mempool with flooding gossip protocol
  # (default)
  # - "nop"   : nop-mempool (short for no operation; the ABCI app is responsible
  # for storing, disseminating and proposing txs). "create_empty_blocks=false"
  # is not supported.
  type = "nop"
  ```

## v0.38.1

*November 17, 2023*

This release contains, among other things, an opt-in, experimental feature to
help reduce the bandwidth consumption associated with the mempool's transaction
gossip.

### BUG FIXES

- `[state/indexer]` Respect both height params while querying for events
   ([\#1529](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/1529))

### FEATURES

- `[metrics]` Add metric for mempool size in bytes `SizeBytes`.
  ([\#1512](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/1512))

### IMPROVEMENTS

- `[mempool]` Add experimental feature to limit the number of persistent peers and non-persistent
  peers to which the node gossip transactions.
  ([\#1558](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/1558))
  ([\#1584](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/1584))
- `[config]` Add mempool parameters `experimental_max_gossip_connections_to_persistent_peers` and
  `experimental_max_gossip_connections_to_non_persistent_peers` for limiting the number of peers to
  which the node gossip transactions. 
  ([\#1558](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/1558))
  ([\#1584](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/1584))

## v0.38.0

*September 12, 2023*

This release includes the second part of ABCI++, called ABCI 2.0.
ABCI 2.0 introduces ABCI methods `ExtendVote` and `VerifyVoteExtension`.
These new methods allow the application to add data (opaque to CometBFT),
called _vote extensions_ to precommit votes sent by validators.
These vote extensions are made available to the proposer(s) of the next height.
Additionally, ABCI 2.0 coalesces `BeginBlock`, `DeliverTx`, and `EndBlock`
into one method, `FinalizeBlock`, whose `Request*` and `Response*`
data structures contain the sum of all data previously contained
in the respective `Request*` and `Response*` data structures in
`BeginBlock`, `DeliverTx`, and `EndBlock`.
See the [specification](./spec/abci/) for more details on ABCI 2.0.

### BREAKING CHANGES

- `[mempool]` Remove priority mempool.
  ([\#260](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/issues/260))
- `[config]` Remove `Version` field from `MempoolConfig`.
  ([\#260](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/issues/260))
- `[protobuf]` Remove fields `sender`, `priority`, and `mempool_error` from
  `ResponseCheckTx`. ([\#260](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/issues/260))
- `[crypto/merkle]` Do not allow verification of Merkle Proofs against empty trees (`nil` root). `Proof.ComputeRootHash` now panics when it encounters an error, but `Proof.Verify` does not panic
  ([\#558](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/issues/558))
- `[state/kvindexer]` Remove the function type from the event key stored in the database. This should be breaking only
for people who forked CometBFT and interact directly with the indexers kvstore.
  ([\#774](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/774))
- `[rpc]` Removed `begin_block_events` and `end_block_events` from `BlockResultsResponse`.
  The events are merged into one field called `finalize_block_events`.
  ([\#9427](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/9427))
- `[pubsub]` Added support for big integers and big floats in the pubsub event query system.
  Breaking changes: function `Number` in package `libs/pubsub/query/syntax` changed its return value.
  ([\#797](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/797))
- `[kvindexer]` Added support for big integers and big floats in the kvindexer.
  Breaking changes: function `Number` in package `libs/pubsub/query/syntax` changed its return value.
  ([\#797](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/797))
- `[mempool]` Application can now set `ConsensusParams.Block.MaxBytes` to -1
  to have visibility on all transactions in the
  mempool at `PrepareProposal` time.
  This means that the total size of transactions sent via `RequestPrepareProposal`
  might exceed `RequestPrepareProposal.max_tx_bytes`.
  If that is the case, the application MUST make sure that the total size of transactions
  returned in `ResponsePrepareProposal.txs` does not exceed `RequestPrepareProposal.max_tx_bytes`,
  otherwise CometBFT will panic.
  ([\#980](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/issues/980))
- `[node/state]` Add Go API to bootstrap block store and state store to a height. Make sure block sync starts syncing from bootstrapped height.
  ([\#1057](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/#1057)) (@yihuang)
- `[state/store]` Added Go functions to save height at which offline state sync is performed.
  ([\#1057](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/#1057)) (@jmalicevic)
- `[p2p]` Remove UPnP functionality
  ([\#1113](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/issues/1113))
- `[node]` Removed `ConsensusState()` accessor from `Node`
  struct - all access to consensus state should go via the reactor
  ([\#1120](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/1120))
- `[state]` Signature of `ExtendVote` changed in `BlockExecutor`.
  It now includes the block whose precommit will be extended, an the state object.
  ([\#1270](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/1270))
- `[state]` Move pruneBlocks from node/state to state/execution.
  ([\#6541](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/6541))
- `[abci]` Move `app_hash` parameter from `Commit` to `FinalizeBlock`
  ([\#8664](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/8664))
- `[abci]` Introduce `FinalizeBlock` which condenses `BeginBlock`, `DeliverTx`
  and `EndBlock` into a single method call
  ([\#9468](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9468))
- `[p2p]` Remove unused p2p/trust package
  ([\#9625](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9625))
- `[rpc]` Remove global environment and replace with constructor
  ([\#9655](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9655))
- `[node]` Move DBContext and DBProvider from the node package to the config
  package. ([\#9655](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9655))
- `[inspect]` Add a new `inspect` command for introspecting
  the state and block store of a crashed tendermint node.
  ([\#9655](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9655))
- `[metrics]` Move state-syncing and block-syncing metrics to
  their respective packages. Move labels from block_syncing
  -> blocksync_syncing and state_syncing -> statesync_syncing
  ([\#9682](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9682))

### BUG FIXES

- `[kvindexer]` Forward porting the fixes done to the kvindexer in 0.37 in PR \#77
  ([\#423](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/423))
- `[consensus]` Unexpected error conditions in `ApplyBlock` are non-recoverable, so ignoring the error and carrying on is a bug. We replaced a `return` that disregarded the error by a `panic`.
  ([\#496](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/496))
- `[consensus]` Rename `(*PeerState).ToJSON` to `MarshalJSON` to fix a logging data race
  ([\#524](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/524))
- `[light]` Fixed an edge case where a light client would panic when attempting
  to query a node that (1) has started from a non-zero height and (2) does
  not yet have any data. The light client will now, correctly, not panic
  _and_ keep the node in its list of providers in the same way it would if
  it queried a node starting from height zero that does not yet have data
  ([\#575](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/issues/575))
- `[abci]` Restore the snake_case naming in JSON serialization of
  `ExecTxResult` ([\#855](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/issues/855)).
- `[consensus]` Avoid recursive call after rename to (*PeerState).MarshalJSON
  ([\#863](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/863))
- `[mempool/clist_mempool]` Prevent a transaction to appear twice in the mempool
  ([\#890](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/890): @otrack)
- `[docker]` Ensure Docker image uses consistent version of Go.
  ([\#9462](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9462))
- `[abci-cli]` Fix broken abci-cli help command.
  ([\#9717](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9717))

### DEPRECATIONS

- `[rpc/grpc]` Mark the gRPC broadcast API as deprecated.
  It will be superseded by a broader API as part of
  [\#81](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/issues/81)
  ([\#650](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/issues/650))

### FEATURES

- `[node/state]` Add Go API to bootstrap block store and state store to a height
  ([\#1057](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/#1057)) (@yihuang)
- `[proxy]` Introduce `NewConnSyncLocalClientCreator`, which allows local ABCI
  clients to have the same concurrency model as remote clients (i.e. one mutex
  per client "connection", for each of the four ABCI "connections").
  ([tendermint/tendermint\#9830](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9830)
  and [\#1145](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/1145))
- `[proxy]` Introduce `NewUnsyncLocalClientCreator`, which allows local ABCI
  clients to have the same concurrency model as remote clients (i.e. one
  mutex per client "connection", for each of the four ABCI "connections").
  ([\#9830](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9830))
- `[abci]` New ABCI methods `VerifyVoteExtension` and `ExtendVote` allow validators to validate the vote extension data attached to a pre-commit message and allow applications to let their validators do more than just validate within consensus ([\#9836](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9836))

### IMPROVEMENTS

- `[blocksync]` Generate new metrics during BlockSync
  ([\#543](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/543))

  bad HTTP responses.
  ([cometbft/cometbft\#638](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/638))
- `[rpc]` Remove response data from response failure logs in order
  to prevent large quantities of log data from being produced
  ([\#654](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/issues/654))
- `[pubsub/kvindexer]` Numeric query conditions and event values are represented as big floats with default precision of 125.
  Integers are read as "big ints" and represented with as many bits as they need when converting to floats.
  ([\#797](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/797))
- `[node]` Make handshake cancelable ([cometbft/cometbft\#857](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/857))

  mempool at `PrepareProposal` time.
  ([\#980](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/980))
- `[node]` Close evidence.db OnStop ([cometbft/cometbft\#1210](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/1210): @chillyvee)
- `[state]` Make logging `block_app_hash` and `app_hash` consistent by logging them both as hex.
  ([\#1264](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/1264))

- `[pubsub]` Performance improvements for the event query API
  ([\#7319](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/7319))

## v0.37.0

*March 6, 2023*

This is the first CometBFT release with ABCI 1.0, which introduces the
`PrepareProposal` and `ProcessProposal` methods, with the aim of expanding the
range of use cases that application developers can address. This is the first
change to ABCI towards ABCI++, and the full range of ABCI++ functionality will
only become available in the next major release with ABCI 2.0. See the
[specification](./spec/abci/) for more details.

In the v0.34.27 release, the CometBFT Go module is still
`github.com/tendermint/tendermint` to facilitate ease of upgrading for users,
but in this release we have changed this to `github.com/cometbft/cometbft`.

Please also see our [upgrading guidelines](./UPGRADING.md) for more details on
upgrading from the v0.34 release series.

Also see our [QA results](https://docs.cometbft.com/v0.37/qa/v037/cometbft) for
the v0.37 release.

We'd love your feedback on this release! Please reach out to us via one of our
communication channels, such as [GitHub
Discussions](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/discussions), with any of your
questions, comments and/or concerns.

See below for more details.

### BREAKING CHANGES

- The `TMHOME` environment variable was renamed to `CMTHOME`, and all environment variables starting with `TM_` are instead prefixed with `CMT_`
  ([\#211](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/issues/211))
- `[p2p]` Reactor `Send`, `TrySend` and `Receive` renamed to `SendEnvelope`,
  `TrySendEnvelope` and `ReceiveEnvelope` to allow metrics to be appended to
  messages and measure bytes sent/received.
  ([\#230](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/230))
- Bump minimum Go version to 1.20
  ([\#385](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/issues/385))
- `[abci]` Make length delimiter encoding consistent
  (`uint64`) between ABCI and P2P wire-level protocols
  ([\#5783](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/5783))
- `[abci]` Change the `key` and `value` fields from
  `[]byte` to `string` in the `EventAttribute` type.

- `[config]` Rename the fastsync section and the
  fast\_sync key blocksync and block\_sync respectively
  ([\#9259](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9259))
- `[types]` Reduce the use of protobuf types in core logic. `ConsensusParams`,
  `BlockParams`, `ValidatorParams`, `EvidenceParams`, `VersionParams` have
  become native types.  They still utilize protobuf when being sent over
  the wire or written to disk.  Moved `ValidateConsensusParams` inside
  (now native type) `ConsensusParams`, and renamed it to `ValidateBasic`.
  ([\#9287](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9287))
- `[abci/params]` Deduplicate `ConsensusParams` and `BlockParams` so
  only `types` proto definitions are use. Remove `TimeIotaMs` and use
  a hard-coded 1 millisecond value to ensure monotonically increasing

  ([\#9287](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9287))
- `[abci]` New ABCI methods `PrepareProposal` and `ProcessProposal` which give
  the app control over transactions proposed and allows for verification of

  ([\#4](https://github.com/informalsystems/tendermint/pull/4))
- `[state/kvindexer]` Fixed the default behaviour of the kvindexer to index and
  query attributes by events in which they occur. In 0.34.25 this was mitigated
  by a separated RPC flag. @jmalicevic

  ([\#9500](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9500))
- `[blocksync]` handle the case when the sending
  queue is full: retry block request after a timeout
  ([\#9518](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9518))

### FEATURES

- `[abci]` New ABCI methods `PrepareProposal` and `ProcessProposal` which give
  the app control over transactions proposed and allows for verification of
  proposed blocks. ([\#9301](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9301))

  `TrySendEnvelope` and `ReceiveEnvelope` to allow metrics to be appended to
  messages and measure bytes sent/received.
  ([\#230](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/230))
- `[abci]` Added `AbciVersion` to `RequestInfo` allowing
  applications to check ABCI version when connecting to CometBFT.
  ([\#5706](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/5706))
- `[cli]` add `--hard` flag to rollback command (and a boolean to the `RollbackState` method). This will rollback
   state and remove the last block. This command can be triggered multiple times. The application must also rollback
   state to the same height.
  ([\#9171](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9171))
- `[crypto]` Update to use btcec v2 and the latest btcutil.

### BREAKING CHANGES

- Rename binary to `cometbft` and Docker image to `cometbft/cometbft`
  ([\#152](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/152))
- The `TMHOME` environment variable was renamed to `CMTHOME`, and all
  environment variables starting with `TM_` are instead prefixed with `CMT_`
  ([\#211](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/issues/211))
- Use Go 1.19 to build CometBFT, since Go 1.18 has reached end-of-life.
  ([\#360](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/issues/360))

### BUG FIXES

- `[consensus]` Fixed a busy loop that happened when sending of a block part
  failed by sleeping in case of error.
  ([\#4](https://github.com/informalsystems/tendermint/pull/4))
- `[state/kvindexer]` Resolved crashes when event values contained slashes,
  introduced after adding event sequences.
  (\#[383](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/383): @jmalicevic)
- `[consensus]` Short-term fix for the case when `needProofBlock` cannot find
  previous block meta by defaulting to the creation of a new proof block.
  ([\#386](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/386): @adizere)
  - Special thanks to the [Vega.xyz](https://vega.xyz/) team, and in particular
    to Zohar (@ze97286), for reporting the problem and working with us to get to
    a fix.
- `[p2p]` Correctly use non-blocking `TrySendEnvelope` method when attempting to
  send messages, as opposed to the blocking `SendEnvelope` method. It is unclear
  whether this has a meaningful impact on P2P performance, but this patch does
  correct the underlying behaviour to what it should be
  ([tendermint/tendermint\#9936](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9936))

### DEPENDENCIES

- Replace [tm-db](https://github.com/tendermint/tm-db) with
  [cometbft-db](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft-db)
  ([\#160](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/160))
- Bump tm-load-test to v1.3.0 to remove implicit dependency on Tendermint Core
  ([\#165](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/165))
- `[crypto]` Update to use btcec v2 and the latest btcutil
  ([tendermint/tendermint\#9787](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9787):
  @wcsiu)

### FEATURES

- `[rpc]` Add `match_event` query parameter to indicate to the RPC that it
  should match events _within_ attributes, not only within a height
  ([tendermint/tendermint\#9759](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9759))

### IMPROVEMENTS

- `[e2e]` Add functionality for uncoordinated (minor) upgrades
  ([\#56](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/56))
- `[tools/tm-signer-harness]` Remove the folder as it is unused

  ([\#204](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/204))
- `[mempool/v1]` Suppress "rejected bad transaction" in priority mempool logs by
  reducing log level from info to debug
  ([\#314](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/314): @JayT106)
- `[consensus]` Add `consensus_block_gossip_parts_received` and
  `consensus_step_duration_seconds` metrics in order to aid in investigating the
  impact of database compaction on consensus performance
  ([tendermint/tendermint\#9733](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9733))
- `[state/kvindexer]` Add `match.event` keyword to support condition evaluation
