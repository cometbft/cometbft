# CHANGELOG

## v0.37.0

*March 6, 2023*

This is the first CometBFT release with ABCI 1.0, which introduces the
`PrepareProposal` and `ProcessProposal` methods, with the aim of expanding the
range of use cases that application developers can address. This is the first
change to ABCI towards ABCI++, and the full range of ABCI++ functionality will
only become available in the next major release with ABCI 2.0. See the
[specification](./spec/abci/) for more details.

In the v0.34.27 release, the CometBFT Go module is still
`github.com/tendermint/tendermint` to facilitate ease of upgrading for users,
but in this release we have changed this to `github.com/cometbft/cometbft`.

Please also see our [upgrading guidelines](./UPGRADING.md) for more details on
upgrading from the v0.34 release series.

Also see our [QA results](https://docs.cometbft.com/v0.37/qa/v037/cometbft) for
the v0.37 release.

We'd love your feedback on this release! Please reach out to us via one of our
communication channels, such as [GitHub
Discussions](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/discussions), with any of your
questions, comments and/or concerns.

See below for more details.

### BREAKING CHANGES

- The `TMHOME` environment variable was renamed to `CMTHOME`, and all environment variables starting with `TM_` are instead prefixed with `CMT_`
  ([\#211](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/issues/211))
- `[p2p]` Reactor `Send`, `TrySend` and `Receive` renamed to `SendEnvelope`,
  `TrySendEnvelope` and `ReceiveEnvelope` to allow metrics to be appended to
  messages and measure bytes sent/received.
  ([\#230](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/230))
- Bump minimum Go version to 1.20
  ([\#385](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/issues/385))
- `[abci]` Make length delimiter encoding consistent
  (`uint64`) between ABCI and P2P wire-level protocols
  ([\#5783](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/5783))
- `[abci]` Change the `key` and `value` fields from
  `[]byte` to `string` in the `EventAttribute` type.
  ([\#6403](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/6403))
- `[abci/counter]` Delete counter example app
  ([\#6684](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/6684))
- `[abci]` Renamed `EvidenceType` to `MisbehaviorType` and `Evidence`
  to `Misbehavior` as a more accurate label of their contents.
  ([\#8216](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/8216))
- `[abci]` Added cli commands for `PrepareProposal` and `ProcessProposal`.
  ([\#8656](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/8656))
- `[abci]` Added cli commands for `PrepareProposal` and `ProcessProposal`.
  ([\#8901](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/8901))
- `[abci]` Renamed `LastCommitInfo` to `CommitInfo` in preparation for vote
  extensions. ([\#9122](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9122))
- Change spelling from British English to American. Rename
  `Subscription.Cancelled()` to `Subscription.Canceled()` in `libs/pubsub`
  ([\#9144](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9144))
- `[abci]` Removes unused Response/Request `SetOption` from ABCI
  ([\#9145](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9145))
- `[config]` Rename the fastsync section and the
  fast\_sync key blocksync and block\_sync respectively
  ([\#9259](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9259))
- `[types]` Reduce the use of protobuf types in core logic. `ConsensusParams`,
  `BlockParams`, `ValidatorParams`, `EvidenceParams`, `VersionParams` have
  become native types.  They still utilize protobuf when being sent over
  the wire or written to disk.  Moved `ValidateConsensusParams` inside
  (now native type) `ConsensusParams`, and renamed it to `ValidateBasic`.
  ([\#9287](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9287))
- `[abci/params]` Deduplicate `ConsensusParams` and `BlockParams` so
  only `types` proto definitions are use. Remove `TimeIotaMs` and use
  a hard-coded 1 millisecond value to ensure monotonically increasing
  block times. Rename `AppVersion` to `App` so as to not stutter.
  ([\#9287](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9287))
- `[abci]` New ABCI methods `PrepareProposal` and `ProcessProposal` which give
  the app control over transactions proposed and allows for verification of
  proposed blocks. ([\#9301](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9301))

### BUG FIXES

- `[consensus]` Fixed a busy loop that happened when sending of a block part failed by sleeping in case of error.
  ([\#4](https://github.com/informalsystems/tendermint/pull/4))
- `[state/kvindexer]` Fixed the default behaviour of the kvindexer to index and
  query attributes by events in which they occur. In 0.34.25 this was mitigated
  by a separated RPC flag. @jmalicevic
  ([\#77](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/77))
- `[state/kvindexer]` Resolved crashes when event values contained slashes,
  introduced after adding event sequences in
  [\#77](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/77). @jmalicevic
  ([\#382](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/382))
- `[consensus]` ([\#386](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/386)) Short-term fix for the case when `needProofBlock` cannot find previous block meta by defaulting to the creation of a new proof block. (@adizere)

- `[consensus]` fix round number of `enterPropose`
  when handling `RoundStepNewRound` timeout.
  ([\#9229](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9229))
- `[docker]` ensure Docker image uses consistent version of Go
  ([\#9462](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9462))
- `[p2p]` prevent peers who have errored from being added to `peer_set`
  ([\#9500](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9500))
- `[blocksync]` handle the case when the sending
  queue is full: retry block request after a timeout
  ([\#9518](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9518))

### FEATURES

- `[abci]` New ABCI methods `PrepareProposal` and `ProcessProposal` which give
  the app control over transactions proposed and allows for verification of
  proposed blocks. ([\#9301](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9301))

### IMPROVEMENTS

- `[e2e]` Add functionality for uncoordinated (minor) upgrades
  ([\#56](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/56))
- `[tools/tm-signer-harness]` Remove the folder as it is unused
  ([\#136](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/issues/136))
- `[p2p]` Reactor `Send`, `TrySend` and `Receive` renamed to `SendEnvelope`,
  `TrySendEnvelope` and `ReceiveEnvelope` to allow metrics to be appended to
  messages and measure bytes sent/received.
  ([\#230](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/230))
- `[abci]` Added `AbciVersion` to `RequestInfo` allowing
  applications to check ABCI version when connecting to CometBFT.
  ([\#5706](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/5706))
- `[cli]` add `--hard` flag to rollback command (and a boolean to the `RollbackState` method). This will rollback
   state and remove the last block. This command can be triggered multiple times. The application must also rollback
   state to the same height.
  ([\#9171](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9171))
- `[crypto]` Update to use btcec v2 and the latest btcutil.
  ([\#9250](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9250))

- `[rpc]` Enable caching of RPC responses
  ([\#9650](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9650))
- `[consensus]` Save peer LastCommit correctly to achieve 50% reduction in gossiped precommits.
  ([\#9760](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9760))

## v0.34.27

*Feb 27, 2023*

This is the first official release of CometBFT - a fork of [Tendermint
Core](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint). This particular release is
intended to be compatible with the Tendermint Core v0.34 release series.

For details as to how to upgrade to CometBFT from Tendermint Core, please see
our [upgrading guidelines](./UPGRADING.md).

If you have any questions, comments, concerns or feedback on this release, we
would love to hear from you! Please contact us via [GitHub
Discussions](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/discussions),
[Discord](https://discord.gg/cosmosnetwork) (in the `#cometbft` channel) or
[Telegram](https://t.me/CometBFT).

Special thanks to @wcsiu, @ze97286, @faddat and @JayT106 for their contributions
to this release!

### BREAKING CHANGES

- Rename binary to `cometbft` and Docker image to `cometbft/cometbft`
  ([\#152](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/152))
- The `TMHOME` environment variable was renamed to `CMTHOME`, and all
  environment variables starting with `TM_` are instead prefixed with `CMT_`
  ([\#211](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/issues/211))
- Use Go 1.19 to build CometBFT, since Go 1.18 has reached end-of-life.
  ([\#360](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/issues/360))

### BUG FIXES

- `[consensus]` Fixed a busy loop that happened when sending of a block part
  failed by sleeping in case of error.
  ([\#4](https://github.com/informalsystems/tendermint/pull/4))
- `[state/kvindexer]` Resolved crashes when event values contained slashes,
  introduced after adding event sequences.
  (\#[383](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/383): @jmalicevic)
- `[consensus]` Short-term fix for the case when `needProofBlock` cannot find

    a fix.
- `[p2p]` Correctly use non-blocking `TrySendEnvelope` method when attempting to
  send messages, as opposed to the blocking `SendEnvelope` method. It is unclear
  whether this has a meaningful impact on P2P performance, but this patch does
  correct the underlying behaviour to what it should be
  ([tendermint/tendermint\#9936](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9936))
