### BREAKING CHANGES

- Rename binary to `cometbft` and Docker image to `cometbft/cometbft`
  ([\#152](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/152))
- The `TMHOME` environment variable was renamed to `CMTHOME`, and all
  environment variables starting with `TM_` are instead prefixed with `CMT_`
  ([\#211](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/issues/211))
- Use Go 1.19 to build CometBFT, since Go 1.18 has reached end-of-life.
  ([\#360](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/issues/360))

### BUG FIXES

- `[consensus]` Fixed a busy loop that happened when sending of a block part
  failed by sleeping in case of error.
  ([\#4](https://github.com/informalsystems/tendermint/pull/4))
- `[state/kvindexer]` Resolved crashes when event values contained slashes,
  introduced after adding event sequences.
  (\#[383](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/383): @jmalicevic)
- `[consensus]` Short-term fix for the case when `needProofBlock` cannot find
  previous block meta by defaulting to the creation of a new proof block.
  ([\#386](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/386): @adizere)
  - Special thanks to the [Vega.xyz](https://vega.xyz/) team, and in particular
    to Zohar (@ze97286), for reporting the problem and working with us to get to
    a fix.
- `[p2p]` Correctly use non-blocking `TrySendEnvelope` method when attempting to
  send messages, as opposed to the blocking `SendEnvelope` method. It is unclear
  whether this has a meaningful impact on P2P performance, but this patch does
  correct the underlying behaviour to what it should be
  ([tendermint/tendermint\#9936](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9936))

### DEPENDENCIES

- Replace [tm-db](https://github.com/tendermint/tm-db) with
  [cometbft-db](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft-db)
  ([\#160](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/160))
- Bump tm-load-test to v1.3.0 to remove implicit dependency on Tendermint Core
  ([\#165](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/165))
- `[crypto]` Update to use btcec v2 and the latest btcutil
  ([tendermint/tendermint\#9787](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9787):
  @wcsiu)

### FEATURES

- `[rpc]` Add `match_event` query parameter to indicate to the RPC that it
  should match events _within_ attributes, not only within a height
  ([tendermint/tendermint\#9759](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9759))

### IMPROVEMENTS

- `[e2e]` Add functionality for uncoordinated (minor) upgrades
  ([\#56](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/56))
- `[tools/tm-signer-harness]` Remove the folder as it is unused
  ([\#136](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/issues/136))

  ([\#204](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/204))
- `[mempool/v1]` Suppress "rejected bad transaction" in priority mempool logs by
  reducing log level from info to debug
  ([\#314](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/314): @JayT106)
- `[consensus]` Add `consensus_block_gossip_parts_received` and
  `consensus_step_duration_seconds` metrics in order to aid in investigating the
  impact of database compaction on consensus performance
  ([tendermint/tendermint\#9733](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9733))
