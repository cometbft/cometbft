# CHANGELOG

## Unreleased

### BREAKING CHANGES

- `[proto]` Renamed the packages from `tendermint.*` to `cometbft.*`
  and introduced versioned packages to distinguish between proto definitions
  released in 0.34.x, 0.37.x, 0.38.x, and 1.0.x versions.
  Prior to the 1.0 release, the versioned packages are suffixed with
  `.v1beta1`, `.v1beta2`, and so on; all definitions describing the protocols
  as per the 1.0.0 release are in packages suffixed with `.v1`.
  Relocated generated Go code into a new `api` folder and changed the import
  paths accordingly.

    `ApplySnapshotChunkResult`, its values named with the
    `APPLY_SNAPSHOT_CHUNK_RESULT_` prefix.

  # The type of mempool for this node to use.
  #
  # Possible types:
  # - "flood" : concurrent linked list mempool with flooding gossip protocol
  # (default)
  # - "nop"   : nop-mempool (short for no operation; the ABCI app is responsible
  # for storing, disseminating and proposing txs). "create_empty_blocks=false"
  # is not supported.
  type = "nop"
  ```

## v0.38.1

*November 17, 2023*

This release contains, among other things, an opt-in, experimental feature to
help reduce the bandwidth consumption associated with the mempool's transaction
gossip.

  ([\#1584](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/1584))

## v0.38.0

*September 12, 2023*

This release includes the second part of ABCI++, called ABCI 2.0.
ABCI 2.0 introduces ABCI methods `ExtendVote` and `VerifyVoteExtension`.
These new methods allow the application to add data (opaque to CometBFT),
called _vote extensions_ to precommit votes sent by validators.
These vote extensions are made available to the proposer(s) of the next height.
Additionally, ABCI 2.0 coalesces `BeginBlock`, `DeliverTx`, and `EndBlock`
into one method, `FinalizeBlock`, whose `Request*` and `Response*`
data structures contain the sum of all data previously contained
in the respective `Request*` and `Response*` data structures in
`BeginBlock`, `DeliverTx`, and `EndBlock`.
See the [specification](./spec/abci/) for more details on ABCI 2.0.

### BREAKING CHANGES

- `[mempool]` Remove priority mempool.
  ([\#260](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/issues/260))
- `[config]` Remove `Version` field from `MempoolConfig`.
  ([\#260](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/issues/260))
- `[protobuf]` Remove fields `sender`, `priority`, and `mempool_error` from
  `ResponseCheckTx`. ([\#260](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/issues/260))
- `[crypto/merkle]` Do not allow verification of Merkle Proofs against empty trees (`nil` root). `Proof.ComputeRootHash` now panics when it encounters an error, but `Proof.Verify` does not panic
  ([\#558](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/issues/558))
- `[state/kvindexer]` Remove the function type from the event key stored in the database. This should be breaking only
for people who forked CometBFT and interact directly with the indexers kvstore.
  ([\#774](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/774))
- `[rpc]` Removed `begin_block_events` and `end_block_events` from `BlockResultsResponse`.
  The events are merged into one field called `finalize_block_events`.
  ([\#9427](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/9427))
- `[pubsub]` Added support for big integers and big floats in the pubsub event query system.
  Breaking changes: function `Number` in package `libs/pubsub/query/syntax` changed its return value.
  ([\#797](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/797))
- `[kvindexer]` Added support for big integers and big floats in the kvindexer.
  Breaking changes: function `Number` in package `libs/pubsub/query/syntax` changed its return value.
  ([\#797](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/797))
- `[mempool]` Application can now set `ConsensusParams.Block.MaxBytes` to -1
  to have visibility on all transactions in the
  mempool at `PrepareProposal` time.
  This means that the total size of transactions sent via `RequestPrepareProposal`
  might exceed `RequestPrepareProposal.max_tx_bytes`.
  If that is the case, the application MUST make sure that the total size of transactions
  returned in `ResponsePrepareProposal.txs` does not exceed `RequestPrepareProposal.max_tx_bytes`,
  otherwise CometBFT will panic.
  ([\#980](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/issues/980))
- `[node/state]` Add Go API to bootstrap block store and state store to a height. Make sure block sync starts syncing from bootstrapped height.
  ([\#1057](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/#1057)) (@yihuang)
- `[state/store]` Added Go functions to save height at which offline state sync is performed.
  ([\#1057](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/#1057)) (@jmalicevic)
- `[p2p]` Remove UPnP functionality
  ([\#1113](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/issues/1113))
- `[node]` Removed `ConsensusState()` accessor from `Node`
  struct - all access to consensus state should go via the reactor
  ([\#1120](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/1120))
- `[state]` Signature of `ExtendVote` changed in `BlockExecutor`.
  It now includes the block whose precommit will be extended, an the state object.
  ([\#1270](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/1270))
- `[state]` Move pruneBlocks from node/state to state/execution.
  ([\#6541](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/6541))
- `[abci]` Move `app_hash` parameter from `Commit` to `FinalizeBlock`
  ([\#8664](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/8664))
- `[abci]` Introduce `FinalizeBlock` which condenses `BeginBlock`, `DeliverTx`
  and `EndBlock` into a single method call
  ([\#9468](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9468))
- `[p2p]` Remove unused p2p/trust package
  ([\#9625](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9625))
- `[rpc]` Remove global environment and replace with constructor
  ([\#9655](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9655))
- `[node]` Move DBContext and DBProvider from the node package to the config
  package. ([\#9655](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9655))
- `[inspect]` Add a new `inspect` command for introspecting
  the state and block store of a crashed tendermint node.
  ([\#9655](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9655))
- `[metrics]` Move state-syncing and block-syncing metrics to
  their respective packages. Move labels from block_syncing
  -> blocksync_syncing and state_syncing -> statesync_syncing
  ([\#9682](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9682))

### BUG FIXES

- `[kvindexer]` Forward porting the fixes done to the kvindexer in 0.37 in PR \#77
  ([\#423](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/423))
- `[consensus]` Unexpected error conditions in `ApplyBlock` are non-recoverable, so ignoring the error and carrying on is a bug. We replaced a `return` that disregarded the error by a `panic`.
  ([\#496](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/496))
- `[consensus]` Rename `(*PeerState).ToJSON` to `MarshalJSON` to fix a logging data race
  ([\#524](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/524))
- `[light]` Fixed an edge case where a light client would panic when attempting
  to query a node that (1) has started from a non-zero height and (2) does
  not yet have any data. The light client will now, correctly, not panic
  _and_ keep the node in its list of providers in the same way it would if
  it queried a node starting from height zero that does not yet have data
  ([\#575](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/issues/575))
- `[abci]` Restore the snake_case naming in JSON serialization of
  `ExecTxResult` ([\#855](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/issues/855)).
- `[consensus]` Avoid recursive call after rename to (*PeerState).MarshalJSON
  ([\#863](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/863))
- `[mempool/clist_mempool]` Prevent a transaction to appear twice in the mempool
  ([\#890](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/890): @otrack)
- `[docker]` Ensure Docker image uses consistent version of Go.
  ([\#9462](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9462))
- `[abci-cli]` Fix broken abci-cli help command.
  ([\#9717](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9717))

### DEPRECATIONS

- `[rpc/grpc]` Mark the gRPC broadcast API as deprecated.
  It will be superseded by a broader API as part of
  [\#81](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/issues/81)
  ([\#650](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/issues/650))

  ([\#1057](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/#1057)) (@yihuang)
- `[proxy]` Introduce `NewConnSyncLocalClientCreator`, which allows local ABCI
  clients to have the same concurrency model as remote clients (i.e. one mutex
  per client "connection", for each of the four ABCI "connections").
  ([tendermint/tendermint\#9830](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9830)
  and [\#1145](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/1145))
- `[proxy]` Introduce `NewUnsyncLocalClientCreator`, which allows local ABCI
  clients to have the same concurrency model as remote clients (i.e. one
  mutex per client "connection", for each of the four ABCI "connections").

- `[abci]` New ABCI methods `VerifyVoteExtension` and `ExtendVote` allow validators to validate the vote extension data attached to a pre-commit message and allow applications to let their validators do more than just validate within consensus ([\#9836](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9836))

### IMPROVEMENTS

- `[blocksync]` Generate new metrics during BlockSync
  ([\#543](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/543))

  bad HTTP responses.
  ([cometbft/cometbft\#638](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/638))
- `[rpc]` Remove response data from response failure logs in order
  to prevent large quantities of log data from being produced
  ([\#654](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/issues/654))
- `[pubsub/kvindexer]` Numeric query conditions and event values are represented as big floats with default precision of 125.
  Integers are read as "big ints" and represented with as many bits as they need when converting to floats.
  ([\#797](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/797))
- `[node]` Make handshake cancelable ([cometbft/cometbft\#857](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/857))

### BUG FIXES

- `[state/kvindex]` Querying event attributes that are bigger than int64 is now
  enabled. We are not supporting reading floats from the db into the indexer
  nor parsing them into BigFloats to not introduce breaking changes in minor
  releases. ([\#771](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/771))
- `[pubsub]` Pubsub queries are now able to parse big integers (larger than
  int64). Very big floats are also properly parsed into very big integers
  instead of being truncated to int64.
  ([\#771](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/771))

### IMPROVEMENTS

- `[rpc]` Remove response data from response failure logs in order
  to prevent large quantities of log data from being produced
  ([\#654](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/issues/654))

### SECURITY FIXES

- `[rpc/jsonrpc/client]` **Low severity** - Prevent RPC
  client credentials from being inadvertently dumped to logs
  ([\#787](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/787))
- `[cmd/cometbft/commands/debug/kill]` **Low severity** - Fix unsafe int cast in
  `debug kill` command ([\#793](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/793))
- `[consensus]` **Low severity** - Avoid recursive call after rename to
  `(*PeerState).MarshalJSON`
  ([\#863](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/863))
- `[mempool/clist_mempool]` **Low severity** - Prevent a transaction from
  appearing twice in the mempool
  ([\#890](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/890): @otrack)

## v0.37.1

*April 26, 2023*

This release fixes several bugs, and has had to introduce one small Go
API-breaking change in the `crypto/merkle` package in order to address what
could be a security issue for some users who directly and explicitly make use of
that code.

### BREAKING CHANGES

- `[crypto/merkle]` Do not allow verification of Merkle Proofs against empty trees (`nil` root). `Proof.ComputeRootHash` now panics when it encounters an error, but `Proof.Verify` does not panic
  ([\#558](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/issues/558))

### BUG FIXES

- `[consensus]` Unexpected error conditions in `ApplyBlock` are non-recoverable, so ignoring the error and carrying on is a bug. We replaced a `return` that disregarded the error by a `panic`.
  ([\#496](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/496))
- `[consensus]` Rename `(*PeerState).ToJSON` to `MarshalJSON` to fix a logging data race
  ([\#524](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/524))
- `[light]` Fixed an edge case where a light client would panic when attempting
  to query a node that (1) has started from a non-zero height and (2) does
  not yet have any data. The light client will now, correctly, not panic
  _and_ keep the node in its list of providers in the same way it would if
  it queried a node starting from height zero that does not yet have data
  ([\#575](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/issues/575))

### IMPROVEMENTS

- `[jsonrpc/client]` Improve the error message for client errors stemming from
  bad HTTP responses.
  ([cometbft/cometbft\#638](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/638))

## v0.37.0

*March 6, 2023*

This is the first CometBFT release with ABCI 1.0, which introduces the
`PrepareProposal` and `ProcessProposal` methods, with the aim of expanding the
range of use cases that application developers can address. This is the first
change to ABCI towards ABCI++, and the full range of ABCI++ functionality will
only become available in the next major release with ABCI 2.0. See the
[specification](./spec/abci/) for more details.

In the v0.34.27 release, the CometBFT Go module is still
`github.com/tendermint/tendermint` to facilitate ease of upgrading for users,
but in this release we have changed this to `github.com/cometbft/cometbft`.

Please also see our [upgrading guidelines](./UPGRADING.md) for more details on
upgrading from the v0.34 release series.

Also see our [QA results](https://docs.cometbft.com/v0.37/qa/v037/cometbft) for
the v0.37 release.

We'd love your feedback on this release! Please reach out to us via one of our
communication channels, such as [GitHub
Discussions](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/discussions), with any of your
questions, comments and/or concerns.

See below for more details.

### BREAKING CHANGES

- The `TMHOME` environment variable was renamed to `CMTHOME`, and all environment variables starting with `TM_` are instead prefixed with `CMT_`
  ([\#211](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/issues/211))
- `[p2p]` Reactor `Send`, `TrySend` and `Receive` renamed to `SendEnvelope`,
  `TrySendEnvelope` and `ReceiveEnvelope` to allow metrics to be appended to
  messages and measure bytes sent/received.
  ([\#230](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/230))
- Bump minimum Go version to 1.20
  ([\#385](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/issues/385))
- `[abci]` Make length delimiter encoding consistent
  (`uint64`) between ABCI and P2P wire-level protocols
  ([\#5783](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/5783))
- `[abci]` Change the `key` and `value` fields from
  `[]byte` to `string` in the `EventAttribute` type.
  ([\#6403](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/6403))
- `[abci/counter]` Delete counter example app
  ([\#6684](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/6684))
- `[abci]` Renamed `EvidenceType` to `MisbehaviorType` and `Evidence`
  to `Misbehavior` as a more accurate label of their contents.
  ([\#8216](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/8216))
- `[abci]` Added cli commands for `PrepareProposal` and `ProcessProposal`.
  ([\#8656](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/8656))
- `[abci]` Added cli commands for `PrepareProposal` and `ProcessProposal`.
  ([\#8901](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/8901))
- `[abci]` Renamed `LastCommitInfo` to `CommitInfo` in preparation for vote
  extensions. ([\#9122](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9122))
- Change spelling from British English to American. Rename
  `Subscription.Cancelled()` to `Subscription.Canceled()` in `libs/pubsub`
  ([\#9144](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9144))
- `[abci]` Removes unused Response/Request `SetOption` from ABCI
  ([\#9145](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9145))
- `[config]` Rename the fastsync section and the
  fast\_sync key blocksync and block\_sync respectively
  ([\#9259](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9259))
- `[types]` Reduce the use of protobuf types in core logic. `ConsensusParams`,
  `BlockParams`, `ValidatorParams`, `EvidenceParams`, `VersionParams` have
  become native types.  They still utilize protobuf when being sent over
  the wire or written to disk.  Moved `ValidateConsensusParams` inside
  (now native type) `ConsensusParams`, and renamed it to `ValidateBasic`.
  ([\#9287](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9287))
- `[abci/params]` Deduplicate `ConsensusParams` and `BlockParams` so
  only `types` proto definitions are use. Remove `TimeIotaMs` and use
  a hard-coded 1 millisecond value to ensure monotonically increasing
  block times. Rename `AppVersion` to `App` so as to not stutter.
  ([\#9287](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9287))
- `[abci]` New ABCI methods `PrepareProposal` and `ProcessProposal` which give
  the app control over transactions proposed and allows for verification of
  proposed blocks. ([\#9301](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9301))

### BUG FIXES

- `[consensus]` Fixed a busy loop that happened when sending of a block part failed by sleeping in case of error.
  ([\#4](https://github.com/informalsystems/tendermint/pull/4))
- `[state/kvindexer]` Fixed the default behaviour of the kvindexer to index and
  query attributes by events in which they occur. In 0.34.25 this was mitigated
  by a separated RPC flag. @jmalicevic
  ([\#77](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/77))
- `[state/kvindexer]` Resolved crashes when event values contained slashes,
  introduced after adding event sequences in
  [\#77](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/77). @jmalicevic
  ([\#382](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/382))
- `[consensus]` ([\#386](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/386)) Short-term fix for the case when `needProofBlock` cannot find previous block meta by defaulting to the creation of a new proof block. (@adizere)
  - Special thanks to the [Vega.xyz](https://vega.xyz/) team, and in particular to Zohar (@ze97286), for reporting the problem and working with us to get to a fix.
- `[docker]` enable cross platform build using docker buildx
  ([\#9073](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9073))
- `[consensus]` fix round number of `enterPropose`
  when handling `RoundStepNewRound` timeout.
  ([\#9229](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9229))
- `[docker]` ensure Docker image uses consistent version of Go
  ([\#9462](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9462))
- `[p2p]` prevent peers who have errored from being added to `peer_set`
  ([\#9500](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9500))
- `[blocksync]` handle the case when the sending
  queue is full: retry block request after a timeout
  ([\#9518](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9518))

### FEATURES

- `[abci]` New ABCI methods `PrepareProposal` and `ProcessProposal` which give
  the app control over transactions proposed and allows for verification of
  proposed blocks. ([\#9301](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9301))

### IMPROVEMENTS

- `[e2e]` Add functionality for uncoordinated (minor) upgrades
  ([\#56](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/56))
- `[tools/tm-signer-harness]` Remove the folder as it is unused
  ([\#136](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/issues/136))
- `[p2p]` Reactor `Send`, `TrySend` and `Receive` renamed to `SendEnvelope`,
  `TrySendEnvelope` and `ReceiveEnvelope` to allow metrics to be appended to
  messages and measure bytes sent/received.
  ([\#230](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/230))
- `[abci]` Added `AbciVersion` to `RequestInfo` allowing
  applications to check ABCI version when connecting to CometBFT.
  ([\#5706](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/5706))
- `[cli]` add `--hard` flag to rollback command (and a boolean to the `RollbackState` method). This will rollback
   state and remove the last block. This command can be triggered multiple times. The application must also rollback
   state to the same height.
  ([\#9171](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9171))
- `[crypto]` Update to use btcec v2 and the latest btcutil.
  ([\#9250](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9250))
- `[rpc]` Added `header` and `header_by_hash` queries to the RPC client
  ([\#9276](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9276))
- `[proto]` Migrate from `gogo/protobuf` to `cosmos/gogoproto`
  ([\#9356](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9356))

- `[mempool/clist_mempool]` **Low severity** - Prevent a transaction from
  appearing twice in the mempool
  ([\#890](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/890): @otrack)

## v0.34.28

## v0.34.27

*Feb 27, 2023*

This is the first official release of CometBFT - a fork of [Tendermint
Core](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint). This particular release is
intended to be compatible with the Tendermint Core v0.34 release series.

  environment variables starting with `TM_` are instead prefixed with `CMT_`
  ([\#211](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/issues/211))
- Use Go 1.19 to build CometBFT, since Go 1.18 has reached end-of-life.
  ([\#360](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/issues/360))

### BUG FIXES

  ([\#386](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/386): @adizere)
  - Special thanks to the [Vega.xyz](https://vega.xyz/) team, and in particular
    to Zohar (@ze97286), for reporting the problem and working with us to get to
    a fix.
- `[p2p]` Correctly use non-blocking `TrySendEnvelope` method when attempting to
  send messages, as opposed to the blocking `SendEnvelope` method. It is unclear
  whether this has a meaningful impact on P2P performance, but this patch does
  correct the underlying behaviour to what it should be
  ([tendermint/tendermint\#9936](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/9936))

### DEPENDENCIES
