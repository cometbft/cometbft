## How to use this image

### Start one instance of the CometBFT with the `kvstore` app

A quick example of a built-in app and CometBFT in one container.

```sh
docker run -it --rm -v "/tmp:/cometbft" cometbft/cometbft init
docker run -it --rm -v "/tmp:/cometbft" cometbft/cometbft node --proxy_app=kvstore
```

## Local cluster

To run a 4-node network, see the `Makefile` in the root of [the repo](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/blob/v0.37.x/Makefile) and run:

```sh
make build-linux
make build-docker-localnode
make localnet-start
```

Note that this will build and use a different image than the ones provided here.
