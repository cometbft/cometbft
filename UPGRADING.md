# Upgrading CometBFT

This guide provides instructions for upgrading to specific versions of CometBFT.

## Unreleased

### Config Changes

* A new config field, `BootstrapPeers` has been introduced as a means of
  adding a list of addresses to the addressbook upon initializing a node. This is an
  alternative to `PersistentPeers`. `PersistentPeers` shold be only used for
  nodes that you want to keep a constant connection with i.e. sentry nodes
* The field `Version` in the mempool section has been removed. The priority
  mempool (what was called version `v1`) has been removed (see below), thus
  there is only one implementation of the mempool available (what was called
  `v0`).
* Config fields `TTLDuration` and `TTLNumBlocks`, which were only used by the priority
  mempool, have been removed.

### Mempool Changes

* The priority mempool (what was referred in the code as version `v1`) has been
  removed. There is now only one mempool (what was called version `v0`), that
  is, the default implementation as a queue of transactions. 
* In the protobuf message `ResponseCheckTx`, fields `sender`, `priority`, and
  `mempool_error`, which were only used by the priority mempool, were removed
  but still kept in the message as "reserved".

### `block_results` RPC endpoint - query result display change (breaking)

* When returning a block, all block events are displayed within the `finalize_block_events` field. 
 For blocks generated with older versions of CometBFT,  that means that block results that appeared
 as `begin_block_events` and `end_block_events` are merged into `finalize_block_events`. 
 For users who rely on the events to be grouped by the function they were generated by, this change
 is breaking.

### kvindexer changes to indexing block events

The changes described here are internal to the implementation of the kvindexer, and they are transparent to the 
user. However, if you own a fork with a modified version of the indexer, you should be aware of these changes. 

* Indexer key for block events will not contain information about the function that returned the event. 
The events were indexed by their attributes, event type, the function that returned them, the height and 
event sequence. The functions returning events in old (pre `v0.38.0`) versions of CometBFT were `BeginBlock` or `EndBlock`. 
As events are returned now only via `FinalizeBlock`, the value of this field has no use, and has been removed. 
The main motivation is the reduction of the storage footprint.  

Events indexed with previous CometBFT or Tendermint Core versions, will still be transparently processed.
There is no need to re-index the events. This function field is not exposed to queries, and was not
visible to users. However, if you forked CometBFT and changed the indexer code directly to accomodate for this,
this will impact your code.

## v0.37.0

This release introduces state machine-breaking changes, and therefore requires a
coordinated upgrade.

### Go API

When upgrading from the v0.34 release series, please note that the Go module has
now changed to `github.com/cometbft/cometbft`.

### ABCI Changes

* The `ABCIVersion` is now `2.0.0`.
* Added new ABCI methods `ExtendVote`, and `VerifyVoteExtension`.
  Applications upgrading to v0.38.0 must implement these methods as described
  [here](./spec/abci/abci%2B%2B_comet_expected_behavior.md#adapting-existing-applications-that-use-abci)
* Removed methods `BeginBlock`, `DeliverTx`, `EndBlock`, and replaced them by
  method `FinalizeBlock`. Applications upgrading to v0.38.0 must refactor
  the logic handling the methods removed to handle `FinalizeBlock`.
* The Application's hash (or any data representing the Application's current state)
  is known by the time `FinalizeBlock` finishes its execution.
  Accordingly, the `app_hash` parameter has been moved from `ResponseCommit`
  to `ResponseFinalizeBlock`.
* For details, please see the updated [specification](spec/abci/README.md)


### RPC

If you rely on the `/tx_search` or `/block_search` endpoints for event querying,
please note that the default behaviour of these endpoints has changed in a way
that might break your queries. The original behaviour was poorly specified,
which did not respect event boundaries.

Please see
[tendermint/tendermint\#9712](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/9712)
for context on the bug that was addressed that resulted in this behaviour
change.

## v0.34.27

This is the first official release of CometBFT, forked originally from
[Tendermint Core v0.34.24][v03424] and subsequently updated in Informal Systems'
public fork of Tendermint Core for [v0.34.25][v03425] and [v0.34.26][v03426].

### Upgrading from Tendermint Core

If you already make use of Tendermint Core (either the original Tendermint Core
v0.34.24, or Informal Systems' public fork), you can upgrade to CometBFT
v0.34.27 by replacing your dependency in your `go.mod` file:

```bash
go mod edit -replace github.com/tendermint/tendermint=github.com/cometbft/cometbft@v0.34.27
```

We make use of the original module URL in order to minimize the impact of
switching to CometBFT. This is only possible in our v0.34 release series, and we
will be switching our module URL to `github.com/cometbft/cometbft` in the next
major release.

### Home directory

CometBFT, by default, will consider its home directory in `~/.cometbft` from now
on instead of `~/.tendermint`.

### Environment variables

The environment variable prefixes have now changed from `TM` to `CMT`. For
example, `TMHOME` or `TM_HOME` become `CMTHOME` or `CMT_HOME`.

We have implemented a fallback check in case `TMHOME` is still set and `CMTHOME`
is not, but you will start to see a warning message in the logs if the old
`TMHOME` variable is set. This fallback check will be removed entirely in a
subsequent major release of CometBFT.

### Building CometBFT

CometBFT must be compiled using Go 1.19 or higher. The use of Go 1.18 is not
supported, since this version has reached end-of-life with the release of [Go 1.20][go120].

### Troubleshooting

If you run into any trouble with this upgrade, please [contact us][discussions].
