# Upgrading CometBFT

This guide provides instructions for upgrading to specific versions of CometBFT.

## v0.34.27

This is the first official release of CometBFT, forked originally from
[Tendermint Core v0.34.24][v03424] and subsequently updated in Informal Systems'
public fork of Tendermint Core for [v0.34.25][v03425] and [v0.34.26][v03426].

### Upgrading from Tendermint Core

If you already make use of Tendermint Core (either the original Tendermint Core
or Informal Systems' public fork), you can upgrade to CometBFT v0.34.27 by
replacing your dependency in your `go.mod` file:

```bash
go mod edit -replace github.com/tendermint/tendermint=github.com/cometbft/cometbft@v0.34.27
```

### Home directory

CometBFT, by default, will consider its home directory in `~/.cometbft` from now
on instead of `~/.tendermint`.

### Environment variables

The environment variable prefixes have now changed from `TM` to `CMT`. For
example, `TMHOME` or `TM_HOME` become `CMTHOME` or `CMT_HOME`.

We have implemented a fallback check in case `TMHOME` is still set and `CMTHOME`
is not, but you will start to see a warning message in the logs if the old
`TMHOME` variable is set. This fallback check will be removed entirely in a
subsequent major release of CometBFT.
