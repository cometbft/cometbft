## Forum Application

The **ABCI 2.0 Forum Application** is a place where users can come and post messages in a forum running on a
blockchain powered by [CometBFT](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft) state machine replication engine

- **Users**

   - Can post messages (by submitting transactions)
   - Can view all the message history (querying the blockchain)
   - Banned if post messages contained curse words (curse words are tracked with vote extensions)
