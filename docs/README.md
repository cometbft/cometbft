# CometBFT

Welcome to the CometBFT documentation!

CometBFT is a blockchain application platform; it provides the equivalent
of a web-server, database, and supporting libraries for blockchain applications
written in any programming language. Like a web-server serving web applications,
CometBFT serves blockchain applications.

More formally, CometBFT performs Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT)
State Machine Replication (SMR) for arbitrary deterministic, finite state machines.
For more background, see [What is CometBFT?](introduction/what-is-cometbft.md).

To get started quickly with an example application, see the [quick start guide](introduction/quick-start.md).

To learn about application development on CometBFT, see the [Application Blockchain Interface](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/tree/main/spec/abci).

For more details on using CometBFT, see the respective documentation for
[CometBFT internals](core/), [benchmarking and monitoring](tools/), and [network deployments](networks/).
