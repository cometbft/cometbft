# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

This is a location to record all high-level architecture decisions in the
CometBFT project.

You can read more about the ADR concept in this
[blog post](https://product.reverb.com/documenting-architecture-decisions-the-reverb-way-a3563bb24bd0#.78xhdix6t).

An ADR should, with a strong focus on the impact on _users_ of the system,
provide:

- Context on the relevant goals and the current state
- Proposed changes to achieve the goals
- Summary of pros and cons
- References
- Changelog

To create a new ADR, please use the [ADR template](./adr-template.md).

Note the distinction between an ADR and a spec. An ADR provides the context,
intuition, reasoning, and justification for a change in architecture, or for the
architecture of something new. A spec is more compressed and streamlined
summary of everything as it stands today.

If recorded decisions turned out to be lacking, convene a discussion, record the
new decisions here, and then modify the code to match.

Note the context/background should be written in the present tense.

## Table of Contents

The following ADRs are exclusively relevant to CometBFT. For historical ADRs
relevant to Tendermint Core as well, please see [this list](./tendermint-core/).
To distinguish CometBFT ADRs from historical ones from Tendermint Core, we start
numbering our ADRs from 100 onwards.
