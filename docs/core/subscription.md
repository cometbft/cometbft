# Subscribing to events via Websocket

CometBFT emits different events, which you can subscribe to via
[Websocket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket). This can be useful
for third-party applications (for analysis) or for inspecting state.

[List of events](https://godoc.org/github.com/cometbft/cometbft/types#pkg-constants)

To connect to a node via websocket from the CLI, you can use a tool such as
[wscat](https://github.com/websockets/wscat) and run:

```sh
wscat -c ws://127.0.0.1:26657/websocket
```

NOTE: If your node's RPC endpoint is TLS-enabled, utilize the scheme `wss` instead of `ws`.

You can subscribe to any of the events above by calling the `subscribe` RPC
method via Websocket along with a valid query.

```json
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "subscribe",
    "id": 0,
    "params": {
        "query": "tm.event='NewBlock'"
    }
}
```

Check out [API docs](https://docs.cometbft.com/main/rpc/) for
more information on query syntax and other options.

You can also use tags, given you had included them into DeliverTx
response, to query transaction results. See [Indexing
transactions](../app-dev/indexing-transactions.md) for details.

## Query parameter and event type restrictions

While CometBFT imposes no restrictions on the application with regards to the type of 
the event output, there are several considerations that need to be taken into account 
when querying events with numeric values.

- Queries convert all numeric event values to `big.Float` , provided by `math/big`. Integers
are converted into a float with a precision equal to the number of bits needed
to represent this integer. This is done to avoid precision loss for big integers when they 
are converted with the default precision (`64`). 
- When comparing two values, if either one of them is a float, the other one will be represented 
as a big float. Integers are again parsed as big floats with a precision equal to the number 
of bits required to represent them. 
- As with all floating point comparisons, comparing floats with decimal values can lead to imprecise 
results. 
- Queries cannot include negative numbers 

Prior to version `v0.38.x`, floats were not supported as query parameters. 

## ValidatorSetUpdates

When validator set changes, ValidatorSetUpdates event is published. The
event carries a list of pubkey/power pairs. The list is the same
CometBFT receives from ABCI application (see [EndBlock
section](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/blob/main/spec/abci/abci++_methods.md#endblock) in
the ABCI spec).

Response:

```json
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 0,
    "result": {
        "query": "tm.event='ValidatorSetUpdates'",
        "data": {
            "type": "tendermint/event/ValidatorSetUpdates",
            "value": {
              "validator_updates": [
                {
                  "address": "09EAD022FD25DE3A02E64B0FE9610B1417183EE4",
                  "pub_key": {
                    "type": "tendermint/PubKeyEd25519",
                    "value": "ww0z4WaZ0Xg+YI10w43wTWbBmM3dpVza4mmSQYsd0ck="
                  },
                  "voting_power": "10",
                  "proposer_priority": "0"
                }
              ]
            }
        }
    }
}
```
