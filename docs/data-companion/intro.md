# Introduction

A Data Companion is a solution proposed in [ADR-101](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/blob/thane/adr-084-data-companion-pull-api/docs/architecture/adr-101-data-companion-pull-api.md) that allows an external application to influence the pruning
of data on a node that exposes the newly introduced gRPC APIs that can govern the pruning on the node.
