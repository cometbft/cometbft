# CometBFT Explained

## The comprehensive guide to understanding CometBFT

This section is designed to provide you with a comprehensive understanding of the core
concepts that underpin CometBFT. You will delve into the block structure, explore the
light client, gain insights into mempool, and learn about state sync, among other essential
concepts.

This section also includes information about the new Data Companion gRPC endpoints
that allow external applications to access data from the node and manage data pruning.
This allows storage optimization and node performance by keeping only necessary data.

By the end of this section, you will have a firm grasp of the fundamental
principles that make CometBFT a powerful technology in the realm of distributed systems.
