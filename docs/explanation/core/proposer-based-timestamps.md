# Proposer-Based Timestamp (PBTS)

This document overviews the Proposer-Based Timestamp (PBTS)
algorithm introduced in CometBFT version v1.0.
It outlines the core functionality of the algorithm and details the consensus
parameters that govern its operation.

## Overview 

The PBTS algorithm defines a way for a blockchain to create block
timestamps that are within a reasonable bound of the validators' clocks on
the network. 
It replaces the BFT Time algorithm for timestamp calculation and assignment, which computes the
timestamp of a block using the timestamps aggregated from precommit messages.

### Block Timestamps

Each block produced by CometBFT contains a timestamp, represented by the `Time`
field of the block's `Header`.

The timestamp of each block is expected to be a meaningful representation of time that is
useful for the protocols and applications built on top of CometBFT.
The following protocols and application features require a reliable source of time:

* Light Clients [rely on correspondence between their known time][light-client-verification] and the block time for block verification.
* Evidence expiration is determined [either in terms of heights or in terms of time][evidence-verification].
* Unbonding of staked assets in the Cosmos Hub [occurs after a period of 21
 days](https://github.com/cosmos/governance/blob/master/params-change/Staking.md#unbondingtime).
* IBC packets can use either a [timestamp or a height to timeout packet
 delivery](https://ibc.cosmos.network/v8/ibc/light-clients/updates-and-misbehaviour?_highlight=time#checkformisbehaviour).

### Enabling PBTS

The PBTS algorithm is **not enabled by default** in CometBFT v1.0.

If a network upgrades to CometBFT v1.0, it will still use the BFT Time
algorithm until PBTS is enabled.
The same applies to new networks that do not change the default values for
consensus parameters in the genesis file.

Enabling PBTS requires configuring the [consensus parameters](#consensus-parameters)
that govern the operation of the algorithm.
There are two `SynchronyParams`, `Precision` and `MessageDelay`, used to
validate block timestamps, as described in the following.
And a `FeatureParams.PbtsEnableHeight` that defines the height from which PBTS
is adopted.

### Selecting a Timestamp

When a validator creates a new block, it reads the time from its local clock
and uses this reading as the timestamp for the block.
The proposer of a block is thus free to select the block timestamp, but this
timestamp must be validated by other nodes in the network.

### Validating Timestamps

When each validator on the network receives a proposed block, it performs a
series of checks to ensure that the block can be considered valid as a
candidate to be the next block in the chain.
If the block is considered invalid, the validator issues a `nil` prevote,
signaling to the rest of the network that the proposed block is not valid.

The PBTS algorithm performs a validity check on the timestamp of proposed
blocks.
This only applies to the first time at which a block is proposed.
If the same block is re-proposed in a future round because it was deemed valid
by the network, this check is not performed.
Refer to the PBTS specification for more details.

When a validator receives a proposal for a new block, it ensures that the timestamp in
the proposal is within a bound of the validator's local clock.
For that it uses `Precision` and `MessageDelay` consensus parameters, 
which are the same across all nodes for a given height.
Specifically, the algorithm checks that the proposed block's timestamp is
no more than `Precision` greater than the node's local clock
(i.e., not in the future)
and no less than `MessageDelay + Precision` behind the node's local clock
(i.e., not too far in the past).
If the proposed block's timestamp is within the window of acceptable
timestamps, the timestamp is considered **timely**.
If the block timestamp is **not timely**, the validator rejects the proposed block by
issuing a `nil` prevote.

### Clock Synchronization

The PBTS algorithm requires the clocks of the validators in the network to be
within `Precision` of each other. In practice, this means that validators
should periodically synchronize their clocks, e.g. to a reliable NTP server.
Validators whose clocks drift too far away from the rest of the network will no
longer propose blocks with valid timestamps. Additionally, they will not consider
the timestamps of blocks proposed by their peers to be valid either.


## Consensus Parameters

The functionality of the PBTS algorithm is governed by two consensus
parameters: the synchronous parameters `Precision` and `MessageDelay`.
An additional consensus parameter `PbtsEnableHeight` is used to enable PBTS
when instantiating a new network or when upgrading an existing a network that
uses BFT Time.

Consensus parameters are configured through the genesis file, for new chains, or by the ABCI application, for new and existing chains, and are the same
across all nodes in the network at any given height.

### `SynchronyParams.Precision`

The `Precision` parameter configures the acceptable upper-bound of clock drift
among all of the validators in the network.
Any two validators are expected to have clocks that differ by at most
`Precision` at any given instant.

The `Precision` parameter is of [`time.Duration`](https://pkg.go.dev/time#Duration) type.

Networks should choose a `Precision` that is large enough to represent the
worst-case for the clock drift among all participants.
Due to the [leap second events](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/7724),
it is recommended to set `Precision` to at least `500ms`.

### `SynchronyParams.MessageDelay`

The `MessageDelay` parameter configures the acceptable upper-bound for the
end-to-end delay for transmitting a `Proposal` message from the proposer to
_all_ validators in the network.

The `MessageDelay` parameter is of [`time.Duration`](https://pkg.go.dev/time#Duration) type.

Networks should choose a `MessageDelay` that is large enough to represent the
delay for a `Proposal` message to reach all participants.
As `Proposal` messages are fixed-size, this delay should not depend, a priori,
on the size of proposed blocks.
But it does depend on the number of nodes in the network, the latency of their
connections, and the level of congestion in the network.

### `FeatureParams.PbtsEnableHeight`

The `PbtsEnableHeight` parameter configures the first height at which the PBTS
algorithm should be adopted for generating and validating block timestamps in a network.

The `PbtsEnableHeight` parameter is an integer.

While `PbtsEnableHeight` is set to `0`, the network will adopt the legacy BFT
Time algorithm.

When `PbtsEnableHeight` is set to a height `H > 0`, the network will switch to
the PBTS algorithm from height `H` on.
The network will still adopt the legacy BFT Time algorithm to produce block
timestamps until height `H - 1`, and to validate block timestamps produced in
heights up to `H - 1`.
The enable height `H` must be a future height when it is configured, namely it
can only be set to a height that is larger than the current blockchain height.

Once `PbtsEnableHeight` is set and the PBTS algorithm is enabled (i.e., from height
`PbtsEnableHeight`), it is not possible to return to the legacy BFT Time algorithm.
The switch to PBTS is therefore irreversible.

Finally, if `PbtsEnableHeight` is set to `InitialHeight` in the genesis file or by the
ABCI `InitChain` method, the network will adopt PBTS from the initial
height. This is the recommended setup for new chains.


## Important Notes

When configuring a network to adopt the PBTS algorithm, the following steps must be considered:

1. Make sure that the clocks of validators are [synchronized](#clock-synchronization) **before** enabling PBTS.
1. Make sure that the configured value for [`SynchronyParams.Precision`](#synchronyparamsprecision) is
   reasonable.
1. Make sure that the configured value for [`SynchronyParams.MessageDelay`](#synchronyparamsmessagedelay) is
   reasonable and large enough to reflect the maximum expected delay for messages in the network.
   Setting this parameter to a small value may impact the progress of the
   network, namely blocks may take very long to be committed.
   - An approach to define this parameter is to observe the latency for
     fixed-size messages (e.g., `Vote` and `Proposal`) over time and define an
     empirical distribution of message delays.
     Then pick as value for the `MessageDelay` parameter, a high percentile of
     this distribution (e.g., the 99th or 99.9th percentiles).
1. Make sure that the block times **currently** produced by the network do not
   differ too much from real time.
   This is specially relevant when block times produced by BFT time are in the
   future, with respect to real time.

### Adaptive MessageDelay

Observation 3. is important because a network that sets
[`SynchronyParams.MessageDelay`](#synchronyparamsmessagedelay) 
to a small value is likely to suffer from long block latencies
and even, in extreme cases, from the complete halt of the network.
By a small value here we mean a message delay that is not enough for an important
portion of the validators to receive the `Proposal` message broadcast by the
proposer of a round within the configured message delay.
If the subset of validators that are unlikely to receive the proposal within the
configured `SynchronyParams.MessageDelay` hold more than 1/3 of the total
voting power of the network, the network could stop producing blocks
indefinitely.

To prevent the network from halting due to the configuration of a small value
for `SynchronyParams.MessageDelay`, we have introduced the concept of
[adaptive synchronous parameters](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/issues/2184).
In summary, this means that the synchrony parameters adopted to verify whether
a proposal timestamp is timely are relaxed as more rounds are required to
commit a block.
The maximum message delay for round 0 is still the configured
`SynchronyParams.MessageDelay`; most blocks are committed in round 0, so there
are no changes for the regular case.
From round 1, the maximum message delay adopted by PBTS slowly increases, at a
rate of 10% per round.
As a result, the adopted maximum message delay will eventually converge to the
actual message delay observed in the network.

While this solution prevents the network from halting, it still delays the
commit of a block by several rounds.
For example, if the configured `SynchronyParams.MessageDelay` is 0.5s but an
important portion of nodes regularly receive the `Proposal` message after 1s,
between 7 and 8 rounds will be necessary to commit a block.
This is an important performance penalty that network operators must avoid at
all costs. Upon noticing this problem, as the network will not halt because of this,
network operators can agree to increase the value of `SynchronyParams.MessageDelay`
in order to fix the problem.

### BFT Times in the future

Observation 4. is important because, with the adoption of PBTS, block times are
expected to converge to values that bear resemblance to real time.
At the same time, the property of monotonicity of block times is guaranteed by both BFT
Time and PBTS.
This means that proposers using PBTS will **wait** until the time they read
from their local clocks becomes bigger than the time of the last committed
block before proposing a new block.

As a result, if the time of the last block produced using BFT Time is too far in
the future, then the first block produced using PBTS will take very long to be
committed: the time it takes for the clock of the proposer to reach the time of
the previously committed block.
To prevent this from happening, first, follow recommendation 1., i.e., synchronize
the validators' clocks.
Then wait until the block times produced by BFT Time converge to values that do
not differ too much from real time.
This may take a long time, because in BFT Time if the value a validator reads
from its local clock is smaller than the time of the previous block, then the
time it sets to a new block will be the time of the previous block plus `1ms`.
It may take a while, but block times will eventually converge to real time.
