# Introduction to ABCI++

`ABCI++` is an evolution of ABCI (Application Blockchain Interface) from Cometbft. It acts as an interface between Cometbft (a state machine replication engine) and the actual state machine being replicated (i.e. the application).

## ABCI++ Functions

### PrepareProposal

This function prepares a proposed block by processing transactions, performing any necessary validation or filtering, and adding or modifying data as needed.

### ProcessProposal

This function validates and executes the proposed block, applying the necessary changes to the blockchain state based on the transactions included in the block.

### ExtendVote

This function extends the voting period for a proposed block, allowing more time for consensus nodes to vote and reach agreement on the validity of the block.

### VerifyVoteExtension

This function verifies the validity of a vote extension proposed by a node, ensuring that it meets certain criteria and can be considered for extending the voting period.

### FinalizeBlock

This function finalizes the state changes made during block processing, performs any necessary post-processing tasks, and prepares the block for persistence or further actions.

### Commit

This function persists the finalized state changes to a durable storage system, ensuring that the changes are permanently stored and can be retrieved later.
