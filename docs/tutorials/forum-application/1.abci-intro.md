# Introduction to ABCI 2.0

`ABCI 2.0` is an evolution of the legacy ABCI (Application Blockchain Interface) from CometBFT.

For comprehensive details and further information on ABCI 2.0, please visit the [specification document](https://docs.cometbft.com/v1.0/spec/abci/).

## ABCI 2.0 Methods

### PrepareProposal

The `PrepareProposal` method enhances block proposals by allowing modifications
before finalization. The block proposer initially collects pending transactions from a mempool, forming a preliminary
"raw proposal." The proposer can then reorder transactions, add new ones, or remove unsuitable ones in this draft to
optimize the block, resulting in a "prepared proposal."

### ProcessProposal

The `ProcessProposal` method permits a validator to assess a block proposal using
specific criteria determined by the application. This functionality allows for the immediate execution of blocks and
allows the application to reject any invalid blocks, which is crucial for maintaining network integrity. Suppose a
proposal is rejected due to invalid content. In that case, the consensus algorithm will then proceed with a nil prevote,
a decision that has significant implications for the liveness of the CometBFT system.

Although the application is generally expected to accept a prepared proposal,’ it can selectively ignore invalid elements,
like erroneous transactions, at the time of block execution. The processing logic in `ProcessProposal` must be deterministic,
ensuring that outcomes are consistent and predictable.

### ExtendVote

The `ExtendVote` method allows validators to add non-deterministic, application-specific
data—called vote extensions—to pre-commit messages, the final voting stage. Not interpreted by the consensus algorithm,
these extensions are sent alongside the votes and become accessible to the application in future rounds when that validator
is the proposer.

`ExtendVote` is invoked when a non-nil pre-commit message is about to be sent. The application returns a
zero-length byte array if no extension data is available. This feature provides flexibility, as the logic in ExtendVote
can be non-deterministic, tailoring how data is added based on application needs.

### VerifyVoteExtension

The `VerifyVoteExtension` method checks the integrity of data in precommit messages,
known as vote extensions, which are from a previous block height. If a vote extension fails validation, the entire
precommit message is deemed invalid, hindering the system's ability to finalize blocks.

It's critical to implement this method carefully to prevent disruptions in block finalization. Typically, an application
should accept an invalid vote extension to maintain consensus but ignore it during operational processing. This verification
is triggered when a precommit message with a vote extension is received for the current height, and must follow deterministic
logic to ensure reliable outcomes.

### FinalizeBlock

The `FinalizeBlock` method processes a decided proposal and provides a comprehensive
response. It includes the results of each transaction, associated events in their original sequence, updates to the
validator set (planned for two heights ahead), and any necessary changes to consensus parameters. The response also
contains the `app_hash`, which verifies the deterministic execution of transactions using an algorithm the application
selects, which ensures the integrity and consistency of the blockchain's state transitions.

It's important to note that while `FinalizeBlock` updates the application's state, these changes do not persist;
this persistence occurs during the `Commit` phase, ensuring proper synchronization and storage of the blockchain data.

### Commit

The `Commit` method is critical for securing the finalized state changes by permanently
storing them in durable storage. Before `Commit`, CometBFT locks the mempool, ensuring no new transactions are processed
and preventing incoming messages on the mempool connection during this crucial step. This precaution allows the application
to update and synchronize its connection states.

During the `Commit` phase, the application must persist its state,
cementing the changes enacted during the `FinalizeBlock` phase and ensuring the blockchain's integrity and reliability.
