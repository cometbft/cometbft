# Running the Application

In previous sections you learned about different ABCI 2.0 methods and how they are used.

In this section you will learn how to run the `Forum Application`.

## Initializing and Running

The application is almost ready to run, but first we'll need to populate the CometBFT configuration file.

The following command will create a cometbft home directory in your project and add a basic set of configuration
files in ~/config/.

For more information on what these files contain see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.cometbft.com/v1.0/references/config/).

### Install comebft

Clone the `cometbft` repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft
```

checkout the latest `v1` release and install it

```bash
cd cometbft
git checkout v1.0.0
make install
```

initialize cometbft:

```bash
cometbft init --home /tmp/forum-app
```

You should see an output similar to the following:

```bash
I[2024-04-23|20:16:43.493] Found private validator                      module=main keyFile=/tmp/forum-app/config/priv_validator_key.json stateFile=/tmp/forum-app/data/priv_validator_state.json
I[2024-04-23|20:16:43.493] Found node key                               module=main path=/tmp/forum-app/config/node_key.json
I[2024-04-23|20:16:43.493] Found genesis file                           module=main path=/tmp/forum-app/config/genesis.json
```

Now build the app:

```go
cd abci/tutorials/abci-v2-forum-app
go build
```

If there are no errors when running the build command above, then everything is now in place to run your application.

> Note: If this is not the first time you're running this application, you need to remove the previously created database, please run
> the command `rm -Rf forum-db` to remove the previous database folder and run from a fresh start

Lets run our Forum Application specifying a home directory (using `--home`) hosted in the `tmp/forum-app` folder
(if you don't specify the home folder, it is created under `$HOME/.cometbft` by default)

```bash
./abci-v2-forum-app --home /tmp/forum-app
```

This should start the full node and connect to our ABCI application, which will be reflected in the application output.

```bash
(abci-v2-forum-app) > ./abci-v2-forum-app --home /tmp/forum-app

```

## Using the application

Let's try submitting a transaction to our new application. Open another terminal window and run the following `curl` command:

### Submit a tx with non curse word

```bash
curl -s 'localhost:26657/broadcast_tx_commit?tx="sender:Ron,message:Music"'
```

If everything went well, you should see a response indicating which height the transaction was included in the blockchain.

```bash
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":-1,"result":{"check_tx":{"code":0,"data":null,"log":"","info":"","gas_wanted":"0","gas_used":"0","events":[],"codespace":""},"tx_result":{"code":0,"data":null,"log":"","info":"","gas_wanted":"0","gas_used":"0","events":[],"codespace":""},"hash":"DD0DD9613C83E5CCDE31342DC49CEF1DD6423271B090BC6A73E800FD163E7ADD","height":"25"}}%
```

Let's make sure that transaction really was persisted by the application. Run the following command:

```bash
curl -s 'localhost:26657/abci_query?data="Ron"'
```

Let's examine the response object that this request returns. The request returns a `json` object with a `key` and `value` field set.

```bash
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": -1,
  "result": {
    "response": {
      "code": 0,
      "log": "\"Music\"",
      "info": "",
      "index": "0",
      "key": "Um9u",
      "value": "Ik11c2ljIg==",
      "proofOps": null,
      "height": "0",
      "codespace": ""
    }
  }
}
```

Those values don't look like the key and value we sent to CometBFT. What's going on here?

The response contains a `base64` encoded representation of the data we submitted. To get the original value out of
this data, we can use the base64 command line utility to view the key (sender) and value (message):

To view the value of `key` (which is the sender) run:

```bash
echo Um9u | base64 -d
```

It will output `Ron`

Then run the command below to view the `value` (which is the message):

```bash
echo Ik11c2ljIg== | base64 -d
```

It will output `Music`

As you can observe, the `Music` message was added by `Ron`.

### Submit a tx with curse word

```bash
curl -s 'localhost:26657/broadcast_tx_commit?tx="sender:Malfoy,message:muggle"'
```

After a certain amount of time you will see a message that tx could not be included in the block. This happens as tx is being rejected in `PrepareProposal`

```bash
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":-1,"error":{"code":-32603,"message":"Internal error","data":"timed out waiting for tx to be included in a block"}}
```

Let's make sure that transaction really was not persisted by the application. Run the following command:

```bash
curl -s 'localhost:26657/abci_query?data="Malfoy"'
```

This should return an error with `Key not found` since the sender and message were not included in the application

```bash
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":-1,"error":{"code":-32603,"message":"Internal error","data":"Key not found"}}
```

### Submit a tx with non curse word for banned user

```bash
curl -s 'localhost:26657/broadcast_tx_commit?tx="sender:Malfoy,message:heroic"'
```

After a certain amount of time you will observe that tx was rejected in `checkTx` since the user has been already banned.

```bash
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":-1,"result":{"check_tx":{"code":3,"data":null,"log":"User is banned","info":"","gas_wanted":"0","gas_used":"0","events":[],"codespace":""},"tx_result":{"code":0,"data":null,"log":"","info":"","gas_wanted":"0","gas_used":"0","events":[],"codespace":""},"hash":"9B110D7648000037B8385562B15810C70E1957AF2F65790B3617CB84C9398536","height":"0"}}%
```

### Checking the chat history

The application can also return the history of messages that were submitted and added to the application. To view the chat
history run the following query:

```bash
curl -s 'localhost:26657/abci_query?data="history"'
```

You can see the chat history in the log field of the response:

```bash
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":-1,"result":{"response":{"code":0,"log":"{sender:Ron,message:Music}","info":"","index":"0","key":"aGlzdG9yeQ==","value":"e3NlbmRlcjpSb24sbWVzc2FnZTpNdXNpY30=","proofOps":null,"height":"0","codespace":""}}}%
```

## Congratulations

Our tutorial on building an ABCI 2 application using CometBFT has come to a close. We hope that the comprehensive tutorial
we've provided has equipped you with the knowledge and skills necessary to develop your own ABCI 2.0 applications with ease and confidence.
