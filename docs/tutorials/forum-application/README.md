# ABCI 2.0 Forum Application Tutorial

In this tutorial, we will build a Forum application using [ABCI 2.0](https://docs.cometbft.com/v1.0/spec/abci/).
A Forum is an application where people can discuss topics by posting messages and responding to each other.

We will demonstrate the use of `ABCI 2.0` methods like - `CheckTx`, `PrepareProposal`, `ProcessProposal`, `FinalizeBlock`,
`ExtendVote` and `VerifyVoteExtension`

Follow the [tutorial](1.abci-intro.md) in order to create a forum application using ABCI 2.0 methods.
