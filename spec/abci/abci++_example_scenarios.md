# Introduction

In the section [CometBFT's expected behaviour](./abci++_comet_expected_behavior.md#valid-method-call-sequences), 
we presented the most common behaviour, usually referred to as the good case. 
However, the grammar specified in the same section is more general and covers more scenarios 
that an Application designer needs to account for. 

In this section, we give more information about these possible scenarios. We focus on methods 
introduced by ABCI++: `PrepareProposal` and `ProcessProposal`. Specifically, we concentrate 
on the part of the grammar presented below.  

```abnf
consensus-height    = *consensus-round decide commit
consensus-round     = proposer / non-proposer

proposer            = [prepare-proposal process-proposal]
non-proposer        = [process-proposal]
```

We can see from the grammar that we can have several rounds before deciding a block. The reasons 
why one round may not be enough are:
* network asynchrony, and
* a Byzantine process being the proposer. 

If we assume that the consensus algorithm decides on block $X$ in round $r$, in the rounds 
$r' <= r$, CometBFT can exhibit any of the following behaviours:

1. Call `PrepareProposal` and/or `ProcessProposal` for block $X$. 
1. Call `PrepareProposal` and/or `ProcessProposal` for block $Y \neq X$.
1. Does not call `PrepareProposal` and/or `ProcessProposal`.

In the rounds when it is the proposer, CometBFT's `PrepareProposal` call is always followed by the 
`ProcessProposal` call. The reason is that the process always delivers the proposal to itself, which 
triggers the `ProcessProposal` call. 

As the number of rounds the consensus algorithm needs to decide in a given run is a priori unknown, the 
application needs to account for any number of rounds, where each round can exhibit any of these three 
behaviours. Recall that the application is unaware of the internals of consensus and thus of the rounds. 

# Possible scenarios
The unknown number of rounds we can have when following the consensus algorithm yields a vast number of 
scenarios we can expect. Listing them all is unfeasible. However, here we give several of them and draw the 
main conclusions. Specifically, we will show that before block $X$ is decided:
    
1. On a correct node, `PrepareProposal` may be called multiple times and for different blocks ([**Scenario 1**](#scenario-1)). 
1. On a correct node, `ProcessProposal` may be called multiple times and for different blocks ([**Scenario 2**](#scenario-2)).
1. On a correct node, `PrepareProposal` and `ProcessProposal` for block $X$ may not be called ([**Scenario 3**](#scenario-3)).
1. On a correct node, `PrepareProposal` and `ProcessProposal` may not be called at all ([**Scenario 4**](#scenario-4)).


## Basic information

Each scenario is presented from the perspective of a process $p$. More precisely, we show what happens in 
each round's $step$ of the [Tendermint consensus algorithm](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.04938.pdf). While in 
practice the consensus algorithm works with respect to voting power of the validators, in this document 
we refer to number of processes (e.g., $n$, $f+1$, $2f+1$) for simplicity. The legend is below: 

### Round X:

1. **Propose:** Describes what happens while $step_p = propose$.
1. **Prevote:** Describes what happens while $step_p = prevote$.
1. **Precommit:** Describes what happens while $step_p = precommit$.

## Scenario 1

$p$ calls `ProcessProposal` many times with different values.

### Round 0:
    
1. **Propose:** The proposer of this round is a Byzantine process, and it chooses not to send the proposal 
message. Therefore, $p$'s $timeoutPropose$ expires, it sends $Prevote$ for $nil$, and it does not call 
`ProcessProposal`. All correct processes do the same. 
1. **Prevote:** $p$ eventually receives $2f+1$ $Prevote$ messages for $nil$ and starts $timeoutPrevote$. 
When $timeoutPrevote$ expires it sends $Precommit$ for $nil$. 
1. **Precommit:** $p$ eventually receives $2f+1$ $Precommit$ messages for $nil$ and starts $timeoutPrecommit$. 
When it expires, it moves to the next round. 
    
### Round 1: 

1. **Propose:** A correct process is the proposer in this round. Its $validValue$ is $nil$, and it is free 
to generate and propose a new block $Y$. Process $p$ receives this proposal in time, calls `ProcessProposal` 
for block $Y$, and broadcasts a $Prevote$ message for it. 
1. **Prevote:** Due to network asynchrony less than $2f+1$ processes send $Prevote$ for this block. 
Therefore, $p$ does not update $validValue$ in this round. 
1. **Precommit:** Since less than $2f+1$ processes send $Prevote$, no correct process will lock on this 
block and send $Precommit$ message. As a consequence, $p$ does not decide on $Y$. 

### Round 2: 

1. **Propose:** Same as in [**Round 1**](#round-1), just another correct process is the proposer, and it 
proposes another value $Z$. Process $p$ receives the proposal on time, calls `ProcessProposal` for new block 
$Z$, and broadcasts a $Prevote$ message for it. 
1. **Prevote:** Same as in [**Round 1**](#round-1).
1. **Precommit:** Same as in [**Round 1**](#round-1).


Rounds like these can continue until we have a round in which process $p$ updates its $validValue$ or until 
we reach round $r$ where process $p$ decides on a block. After that, it will not call `ProcessProposal` 
anymore for this height. 

## Scenario 2 

$p$ calls `PrepareProposal` many times with different values.

### Round 0: 

1. **Propose:** Process $p$ is the proposer in this round. Its $validValue$ is $nil$, and it is free to 
generate and propose new block $Y$. Before proposing, it calls `PrepareProposal` for $Y$. After that, it 
broadcasts the proposal, delivers it to itself, calls `ProcessProposal` and broadcasts $Prevote$ for it. 
1. **Prevote:** Due to network asynchrony less than $2f+1$ processes receive the proposal on time and send 
$Prevote$ for it. Therefore, $p$ does not update $validValue$ in this round. 
1. **Precommit:** Since less than $2f+1$ processes send $Prevote$, no correct process will lock on this 
block and send non-$nil$ $Precommit$ message. As a consequence, $p$ does not decide on $Y$. 

After this round, we can have multiple rounds like those in [Scenario 1](#scenario-1). The important thing 
is that process $p$ should not update its $validValue$. Consequently, when process $p$ reaches the round 
when it is again the proposer, it will ask the mempool for the new block again, and the mempool may return a 
different block $Z$, and we can have the same round as [Round 0](#round-0-1) just for a different block. As 
a result, process $p$ calls `PrepareProposal` again but for a different value. When it reaches round $r$ 
some process will propose block $X$ and if $p$ receives $2f+1$ $Precommit$ messages, it will decide on this 
value. 


## Scenario 3 

$p$ calls `PrepareProposal` and `ProcessProposal` for many values, but decides on a value for which it did 
not call `PrepareProposal` or `ProcessProposal`.

In this scenario, in all rounds before $r$ we can have any round presented in [Scenario 1](#scenario-1) or 
[Scenario 2](#scenario-2). What is important is that:
- no proposer proposed block $X$ or if it did, process $p$, due to asynchrony, did not receive it in time, 
so it did not call `ProcessProposal`, and

- if $p$ was the proposer it proposed some other value $\neq X$. 

### Round $r$: 

1. **Propose:** A correct process is the proposer in this round, and it proposes block $X$. 
Due to asynchrony, the proposal message arrives to process $p$ after its $timeoutPropose$
expires and it sends $Prevote$ for $nil$. Consequently, process $p$ does not call
`ProcessProposal` for block $X$. However, the same proposal arrives at other processes
before their $timeoutPropose$ expires, and they send $Prevote$ for this proposal.
1. **Prevote:** Process $p$ receives $2f+1$ $Prevote$ messages for proposal $X$, updates correspondingly its 
$validValue$ and $lockedValue$ and sends $Precommit$ message. All correct processes do the same. 
1. **Precommit:** Finally, process $p$ receives $2f+1$ $Precommit$ messages, and decides on block $X$. 



## Scenario 4

[Scenario 3](#scenario-3) can be translated into a scenario where $p$ does not call `PrepareProposal` and 
`ProcessProposal` at all. For this, it is necessary that process $p$ is not the proposer in any of the 
rounds $0 <= r' <= r$ and that due to network asynchrony or Byzantine proposer, it does not receive the 
proposal before $timeoutPropose$ expires. As a result, it will enter round $r$ without calling 
`PrepareProposal` and `ProcessProposal` before it, and as shown in Round $r$ of [Scenario 3](#scenario-3) it 
will decide in this round. Again without calling any of these two calls.
