# This test intends to verify the reliability of the data retention settings, and pruning behavior.
# Retention of blocks for full nodes is set at 14 (the minimum given the evidence age settings),
# this means that full nodes will retain at least the last 14 blocks of data.
# The 'enable_companion_pruning' flags for the first two full nodes are set to 'true'; since there is
# no actual data companion running in this setup, it effectively prevents the actual pruning from kicking in.
